<span>THE PLEA FOR HELP</span>
</h2>

<p>“Well, now that everything is going all right at
the camp here, I suppose we might as well say
goodbye to our friends and get ready for the return
to the West Branch and resume our duties on the
forest fire patrol,” remarked Garfield Boone to his
chums as they sat in the crude office of the lumber
camp.</p>

<p>“Yes, this seems to be the best thing to do, but I
almost dislike the thought of going back. After all
the excitement that we’ve had lately, it will be dead
slow on the hill. Nothing to do but walk the patrol
and take our turns in the Tin Can,” agreed Phil
Durant.</p>

<p>The third member of the trio of friends, tried
and true, merely yawned and said nothing. This
was Dick Wallace, rather a heavy chap. Some people
would have called him fat, but he always referred
to himself as merely plump.</p>

<p>“Come, say something, Dick. You’ve been sitting
here for an hour and the most you’ve said is
yes or no, sometimes you didn’t even say that.
What’s the trouble?” inquired Garry.</p>

<p>“Gosh, can’t you fellows see that I’m just resting?
You want me to say something? All right.
I wonder what we’ll have for dinner today?”</p>

<p>His friends broke into hearty laughter. Dick’s
appetite was a standing joke with them, likewise his
weight; for he always took the easiest way of
doing things when speed was not required. This
does not mean that the fat youth was a shirker or
naturally lazy. When occasion demanded it, he
was all speed and as quick as a flash of lightning.
Like many heavy people, he could move with the
utmost celerity if need be, but his attitude was why
hurry when you didn’t have to. Time enough for
that when something arose that demanded action.</p>

<p>“I say, boys, there’s old Lawrence with a mail
bag. You know he went to town at daybreak to
get the mail. Wonder if there’s anything for us?”
remarked Phil, as he spied the old lumberjack coming
towards them.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder if there was a letter from
home for some of us,” answered Garry, as he stuck
his head out of the door and called to the man to
bring them what mail there was.</p>

<p>“Three for Garry, one apiece for the rest of you,”
said Lawrence, as he handed them the small bundle
of envelopes.</p>

<p>The boys made a dive for the mail and soon each
was busily engaged in perusing the letter or letters
sent him.</p>

<p>As they are reading their letters, let us get acquainted
with the heroes of this coming volume.
Those of our readers who have read the preceding
four volumes in this series, “<span class='sc'>The Ranger Boys to
the Rescue</span>,” “<span class='sc'>The Ranger Boys Find the
Hermit</span>,” “<span class='sc'>The Ranger Boys and the Border
Smugglers</span>,” and “<span class='sc'>The Ranger Boys Outwit
the Timber Thieves</span>,” are already acquainted
with the trio and the stirring adventures they have
had. For the benefit of others, however, we will
give a slight history of what they have done.</p>

<p>The three boys, whose names we already know,
have just finished their junior year in high school,
and while wondering what to do for their last vacation
together, are told by Garry’s father, a wealthy
timberland owner, that he will get them places in
the Maine Forest Ranger Service.</p>

<p>The duty of the men on this service is to patrol
the forests constantly on the lookout for forest
fires, and if any are discovered, to report them
promptly, as well as trying to do what they can to
put out the blaze.</p>

<p>A short way up the river near their home the
boys have a shack, and one afternoon they go there
to find it occupied by three tramps who seize Phil
and Garry. Dick makes his escape and brings help
from town.</p>

<p>It is discovered that the three are badly wanted
for robbing postoffices, and the chums receive a sizable
reward for their capture.</p>

<p>This money they use, or rather a part of it, to
outfit themselves for the forest. On the way to
their work they make friends with one Nate Webster,
an old Maine guide who later does them many
a good turn. They also incur the enmity of a
French Canadian halfbreed named Jean LeBlanc,
who finds out that one is the son of Mr. Boone, a
man he has hated for years.</p>

<p>While on their patrol they meet a party of New
York campers, and are instrumental in saving the
little daughter of Mr. Graham, head of the party.
A day or two later LeBlanc captures the child and
intends to hold it for ransom.</p>

<p>A queer, unknown individual writes them constant
notes informing them of what is going on.
This man they call the Hermit. Garry finally rescues
little Patty, and LeBlanc is captured only to
break out of jail later on.</p>

<p>The halfbreed continually crosses their trail, causing
them all kinds of trouble, and several times endangering
their lives. He sets fire to the forest,
and almost causes the death of the boys and a party
of motion picture people who are taking a forest
picture. Having checkmated him, they set out to
find the Hermit, following a clue given them in a
cipher note, and Dick succeeds in finding the old
man, who is evidently a gentleman, yet seems to be
a trifle unbalanced mentally.</p>

<p>So well do they succeed at their work in the
forest, that when a gang of fur smugglers start
operations on the Canadian border, the Chief
Ranger recommends to the Customs authorities that
they be sent to help.</p>

<p>They are instrumental in aiding an old man who
has been caught in a disused bear trap in the woods,
and meet his granddaughter Ruth. They get evidence
against the smugglers after some thrilling escapes,
and find that part of the contraband of the
smugglers includes some wonderful jewels. LeBlanc
is mixed up in this, but makes his escape
across the border, where the American Customs authorities
cannot pursue him.</p>

<p>Coming into possession of a torn map, they work
out its solution and discover a rich mine of tourmalines,
those gems that are famous in the State of
Maine, and are valuable both as jewels and as parts
of electrical apparatus.</p>

<p>As they plan to return to their work as Rangers,
they are asked by Mr. Boone to aid him in unraveling
the mystery of the trouble at his summer logging
camp.</p>

<p>Again they find LeBlanc is mixed up in the theft
of the timber, and after a half a dozen narrow
escapes from disaster, meet with success. LeBlanc
makes a mad dash for freedom and succeeds in
swimming to meet a motor boat containing some
of his friends, including his brother, Baptiste, who
is just as great a villain as Jean.</p>

<p>In several of their adventures they have put to
good use a wireless telephone outfit given them by
Mr. Graham in gratitude for the double rescue of
his little daughter, Patty.</p>

<p>In the preceding volume Dick called for help
when the timber thieves had besieged the camp and
captured the men loyal to Mr. Boone. Through
the machinations of Barrows, the camp manager,
much of the timber had been stolen, and enough
harm done to seriously hinder Boone from keeping
his contracts to deliver a certain supply of lumber at
a set date.</p>

<p>Thanks to the boys’ work, however, the plot was
nipped before it had gotten too far, and so we meet
them now in the camp office after order has been
restored, and the men are working doubly hard to
aid their employer.</p>

<p>Just one more thing must be explained, and that
is the mystery that entered Dick’s life when he was
a mere child. His father, a friend of Garry’s father,
had been professor of botany at an Eastern university.
Dick’s mother died when he was a baby. One
day Professor Wallace fell from his horse and received
an injury that made him lose his memory.
Before he could be operated upon he escaped from
the hospital, in delirium, and had not been heard of
from that day.</p>

<p>Out of sincere friendship for his old schoolmate,
Mr. Boone had taken Dick into his home and, after
formally adopting him, brought him up as he did
his own son, Garry.</p>

<p>Now to return to the boys, who are just finishing
their letters.</p>

<p>“Who is all that mail for you from?” quizzed
Phil, as he spied Garry finishing his third letter.</p>

<p>“Well, you chaps were pining for more excitement,
and dreading to go back to the humdrum
patrolling of the forest, and it looks as though your
desire for action was to be gratified,” answered
Garry. “One of these letters is from Mother. The
other two are from Augusta; that is, one is from
the Chief Ranger and the other is enclosed in his
message. That one is from a young lady.”</p>

<p>“What young lady would write to you, anyway,
and why should she send it through the Ranger?”
scoffed Phil.</p>

<p>“It’s from a young lady who lives on the Canadian
border. Does that tell you anything?” replied
Garry.</p>

<p>“Aha,” shouted Dick, as light broke on him.
“Phil, it’s a love letter!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” retorted Garry, though he
flushed up a bit. “It’s a plea for help.”</p>

<p>This made the others stop their good-natured
chaffing of their leader, for it was Garry who was
the elected chief of the trio, and they importuned
him to hurry up and read the messages.</p>

<p>“First, then, is the one from Ruth, who says that
she and her grandfather have received several
threatening letters, claiming that all kinds of misfortune
will follow them unless they leave their
home and get out of that section of the country.
Along with her letter is the one from the Chief
Ranger, who says that in addition to the threatening
letters that have been sent, there are some peculiar
doings in the postal way at Hobart, and as we
had such success in helping the Customs man, he
has recommended that we be sent to Hobart to aid
the postal inspector, who is on his way there now.
So that’s the story in a nutshell.”</p>

<p>Dick jumped to his feet, all his “resting”
forgotten. He seized Phil by the shoulders and did a regular
war dance, dragging the protesting Phil, who
was of a quieter disposition, around the floor of
the office.</p>

<p>“Whe-e-e—, that means a trip back to the border,
and all kinds of things may happen there again.
Let’s get going; we can pack in a few minutes and
get to town in time to catch a late train for Bangor.”</p>

<p>“All right; see how quick we can get packed up.
Also, I wish one of you boys would pack up for me;
some of my stuff is scattered around the shack; and
be sure and pack the radio carefully. I had it out
overhauling it this morning. I want to arrange
about leaving, and see Art Howells, the new manager,
and tell him to try and get some trace of
Sandy before we go.”</p>

<p>The mention of Sandy brought sadness to the
boys. He was a big Airedale that they all loved,
and had been stolen or wandered away a short time
after they had reached the logging camp.</p>

<p>Away went the chums to pack, and Garry
sought out Howells. The new manager assured
Garry that he would do his best to find some track
of the dog.</p>

<p>Howells also sent a man to get Mr. Boone, who
was still at the camp helping reorganize the men
after the trouble of the preceding days. When
Garry returned to the office, he found his chums,
awaiting him. They had packed in a hurry, for
Dick was still stuffing down the contents of his
knapsack as Garry entered the shack.</p>

<p>“We’ll be all set in a few minutes,” declared
Dick. “Have you sent for Dad Boone, Garry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll be here in a few minutes; he is only
at the sawmill. Sure you have everything packed?
Haven’t you forgotten anything?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>“Everything is as right as a trivet,” answered
Phil. “Wonder if we can get the old Ford that was
brought here yesterday to ride into town on; it will
save us a long hike and will get us there quicker.”</p>

<p>“Guess we can have it all right; we’ll see as
soon as Father comes,” answered Garry.</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Boone entered the office, and
noticing the excited air of the boys, and the packed
knapsacks, asked in some surprise if they were not
in an awful hurry to get back to work.</p>

<p>It took only a few hasty words to acquaint him
with the new situation that had just arisen, and as
Garry concluded the explanation he asked for the
use of the old auto to carry them to town.</p>

<p>This request was readily granted by Mr. Boone,
and he wished the boys good luck on their venture.</p>

<p>“I had hoped that you would go back to the
mountain for the rest of the summer,” he said,
“where there is some peace and quietness. It seems
that you have stepped into trouble at almost every
turn, and there is only one thing that I worry about.
That is LeBlanc. He is a most vindictive rascal,
and I will not feel confident of your security until
you are off to school this fall or until he is safely
under lock and key in some prison, where he belongs.
I hope you boys have no wild times on this, yet I
would be the last one to ask you to shirk your duty;
and since the Chief Ranger has such a high regard
for you, who are yet boys, to send you on such an
errand, I can only say I’m proud that you have
done so well, and deserve all the praise that can be
accorded to you. Also, I wish that you would postpone
your departure for a few minutes, as I want
to write a note to Nate Webster for you to mail
when you get to Bangor. It will go quicker then,
for the train that you will take this afternoon does
not carry mail.”</p>

<p>Naturally they agreed to this, and went outside
while Mr. Boone wrote his note. In some way it
had been noised about the camp that the boys were
to leave, and soon several of the men had gathered
in front of the office. Mr. Boone finished his letter,
and gave it to Garry and they got into the flivver.
The man called Tom, who had taken them on the
coon hunt some nights before, started several times
to speak, and then decided not to.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to start, Garry called to
Art Howells to be sure and keep an eye out for
news of Sandy’s fate. There was a gulp in his
throat as he said this. His chums, too, were silent,
for they missed their faithful, four-footed friend
sorely.</p>

<p>This evidently decided Tom, for he came to the
flivver, and said to Garry:</p>

<p>“If you can get me time off enough to go to
town with you, I promise you that you will have
your dog a half an hour after we reach there!”</p>

<h2 id='chII'
  class='chapter' title='II. BAD NEWS IN HOBART'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER II</span><br/>
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>BAD NEWS IN HOBART</span>
</h2>

<p>On hearing this, the boys gave a shout of joy,
and in a minute had arranged for Tom to come
with them as far as town.</p>

<p>With the cheers of the lumberjacks sounding in
their ears, and with a wave of Mr. Boone and Art
Howells, the boys were off. The flivver coughed,
and gathering speed, rattled down the bumpy road.</p>

<p>As soon as they had started, they hurled a number
of questions at Tom about Sandy.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t goin’ to say anything about the dog,
because you fellows might take it out on us. My
brother came to see me in camp the day after the
coon hunt, and stayed around for awhile and made
half sort of friends with the dog, and then later he
was gone. I found out that he had taken him with
him. ’Course I know it was stealing, but he was
my brother and I was afraid he would get into bad
trouble. You fellows know how I felt. First place
I was ashamed to tell you I had a brother that
would do that, and second place I was afraid you’d
have him taken up for it. But I was going to see
that you got him back somehow. When you got
ready to go today, I knew how you felt about the
pup, and so I couldn’t hold in any longer. All I
wish is that you won’t have anything done to my
brother, bad as he is.”</p>

<p>The boys were so overjoyed with the thought
of regaining Sandy that they immediately promised
Tom that the matter would be forgotten.</p>

<p>Speeding up the machine as soon as they struck
better road, they made excellent time and reached
the village ahead of their schedule. They went
direct to the station to get their tickets, while Tom
departed for his brother’s house to bring Sandy to
them. After buying their tickets, they were on
tenterhooks waiting the return of their animal
friend.</p>

<p>True to his word, Tom was at the station in
half an hour. But Sandy beat him by several seconds,
for no sooner did he get his first sight of
the boys than he broke from the leash by which
Tom was leading him and made a mad dash for
the chums. He nearly knocked Garry over as he
leaped on him, then he jumped from one boy to
another in frantic glee, giving vent to sharp barks
of delight as the boys mauled him in their joy at
seeing him again.</p>

<p>“Sorry we’ll have to put you in the baggage car
on the trip, old timer,” said Garry, “but the railroads
have a rule against big fellows like you
being in the car.”</p>

<p>At last the train came in and they were on their
way. Sandy voiced unqualified disapproval at
being tied up in the crowded baggage car, and occasionally
one or another of the boys went ahead and
petted him a few minutes.</p>

<p>The train was a slow one, and it was nearly eight
o’clock when they reached the Penobscot River
city. For once they were quite ready to follow
Dick’s lead and get “eats,” then they went to the
hotel and reserved rooms. They found that their
train was to leave fairly early in the morning, but
as not one of them was tired, they took a walk
down through the business center of the town.</p>

<p>As they passed a brightly lighted drug store,
Dick noticed something in the window.</p>

<p>“There, I knew there was something we ought to
have had on our other trips,” he announced to the
others.</p>

<p>“Hold him, Phil, he’s going to buy something
again. Remember how he wouldn’t go on without
that knife last time he was here?” said Garry.</p>

<p>“Gosh, that reminds me I left that knife in the
cabin at the little lake,” he ejaculated. “I wonder
if that chap is still around here selling ’em?”</p>

<p>“Hardly; he was just one of those sidewalk
merchants that are here today and gone tomorrow”
answered Garry. “But what is it that you want to
buy now?”</p>

<p>“Look at that display in the window, and see if
you don’t think we ought to have an outfit” answered
Dick as he waved his hand toward the indicated window.</p>

<p>“Well, for once you see something sensible. We
might have a lot of use for them the remainder of
the summer, and it will give us some nice souvenirs.”</p>

<p>What Dick had seen was a display of cameras,
and followed by his chums he entered the store and
soon had purchased a good camera and a sufficient
quantity of films to take a number of pictures. As
an afterthought, he bought material to develop a
limited amount of the pictures, explaining that they
might be able to print some in spare moments.</p>

<p>“Go ahead and buy whatever you want,” laughed
Garry, “only remember that this stuff all goes in
your pack, and you will have to carry the extra
weight.”</p>

<p>This, however, failed to bother Dick, and he
bought such articles as he needed.</p>

<p>They were about to return to the hotel, when
Garry noticed a policeman coming down the street.
This called to mind the night they had been near
arrest and had received the torn map that eventually
led them to the secret tourmaline mine.</p>

<p>“Let’s drop around to the station and see if the
Chief of Police might be in. I’d like to say howdy
to him, even if he once did have an idea that we
were a crew of runaways,” he suggested to his companions.</p>

<p>The idea was instantly approved, and they
changed their direction and headed for the station.
They were just in time, for the Chief was preparing
to leave for home. He recognized the boys
immediately and invited them into his office for a
chat. The few minutes lengthened into an hour,
for the Chief made them tell him about the smuggling
band and how they had aided in the capture.</p>

<p>“I happen to know something about it, for some
of them were brought here for a hearing before the
United States Commissioner, and I attended the
hearing. It’s natural in you boys, I suppose, to be
modest about it, but I wish that I had a son, or three
of them like you, that could get out and do such a
creditable bit of work as you did. If you ever want
a job, apply to me,” he concluded with a laugh in
which the boys joined.</p>

<p>The visit over, they hustled back to the hotel and
to sleep, as they were booked for early rising.</p>

<p>A sharp tatoo on the door awoke them in the
morning, and they hurried into their clothes, for
they had no more than time to eat and get to the
station.</p>

<p>Aboard the train they chose seats, as was their
custom, in the smoking car, not that any of the trio
was addicted to smoking, but because they generally
found several interesting characters to watch,
and this happened to pass away the time.</p>

<p>Then, too, on one occasion, they had obtained a
valuable clue that aided them greatly in the successful
carrying out of the mission they had been sent
on, and on their first trip they had made the acquaintance
of Nate Webster in the smoker of a
train.</p>

<p>They found facing seats and stowed their packs
and rifles in the racks overhead, and settled down
for the weary ride that would take them to Hobart.
As was usual in this train, there were a number of
picturesque characters: lumberjacks going north to
the woods, guides returning after taking parties on
camping trips, or going to meet parties that were
awaiting them along the way, French Canadians
bound for towns on the other side of the border,
and several men who were evidently bound on an
extended fishing trip, to judge from the paraphernalia
they carried with them. The boys were just
a little bit amused at the amount of luggage that
they carried. It was piled at one end of the car,
and from the looks of it would have required the
services of at least three porters to carry for them.
This, by the way, is the mistake made by the average
camper, unless someone wise in the ways of
the woods gives them a friendly tip and tells them
to travel light.</p>

<p>Each of the boys always made shift to travel with
only one knapsack each and everything that was
not absolutely necessary was discarded. As it was,
their packs were quite heavy, for they had their
carrying sets of the wireless ’phone; but these were
fairly light, since they had been specially made for
the Rangers by Mr. Graham.</p>

<p>Garry and Dick amused themselves by playing
checkers on a small pocket board that was their
constant companion, while Phil wandered through
the car stopping to watch several of the card games
that were in progress and listening to the conversation.
As our previous readers know, Phil could
talk French as well as he could English, but this
was an accomplishment that the trio kept a strict
secret, since it enabled them at times to get valuable
information. Naturally a great deal of this
language was spoken in this section of the country,
and more so as they approached the border and
other men got aboard.</p>

<p>Phil’s trip was fruitless as far as getting any
information was concerned, for all the men were
talking only of the most trivial subjects.</p>

<p>“What luck?” asked Garry, when Phil finally
returned to his seat.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. There is no one on the train
that I remember having seen when we were here
before, and everyone seems to be all right. It is
unlikely that I should have found out anything
about the postal trouble, for there is probably some
single person at the bottom of that, rather than a
band such as that of the smugglers that we ran
down last time,” said Phil. “But there is one thing
that I thought of as I walked through the cars.
We will be only a short hike away from our mine
when we get to Hobart, and I wonder if we
wouldn’t have time to make a little visit there and
see that no one else has stumbled on the secret. I
wish I could pick about twenty of the best tourmalines,
for the money they would bring would be
mighty welcome.”</p>

<p>“Guess great minds run in the same channel,”
remarked Garry, “for I was thinking of the same
thing not very long ago. But I have a better idea.
By the time we get this business here settled up, it
will be fairly well along in the summer, and it
seems to me it would be useless to go back to the
patrol for such a short time. We will want to have
a few days at home before we go to military school
this fall, and so I suggest that after this mission is
ended, we get relieved from duty and go and mine
some of the tourmalines. We ought to get quite a
bit of the work done, for it is a comparatively easy
job to get them out, and then we can hire a couple
of guards to watch them until such time as we can
come back, or get some trustworthy person to operate
it for us; such a man as Nate Webster, for instance.”</p>

<p>“That would be a jolly good idea,” remarked
Dick. “I’d like a chance at mining just to see how
the thing is done.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to forget about that for the
time being, for we have a big enough job on our
hands for the present if we meet with any success
on this business. As a matter of fact, we won’t be
able to do a great deal on this anyway. It is something
that we know nothing about, and I imagine
that the only reason we were sent here at all is
because we have had a chance to learn something
about the country here and know some of the people
in Hobart. As for giving any advice to the inspector,
that of course is out of the question.
Really, this thing looks more like a vacation to me
than anything else,” concluded Garry.</p>

<p>“You never can tell what will happen,” remarked
Dick sagely. “There’s one thing I would like to do
before we quit here for the summer, and that is
cause LeBlanc to be taken up and held where he
can do no more mischief for a time. He gets worse
every week, and there is no telling what he will do
in the end. I wonder if he is the one that sent the
letters to our friends? You know they were instrumental
in bringing his smuggling plot to a disastrous end,
and he is of the vengeful type that would
seek some mean satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“I rather doubt that he is the one,” said Garry.
“It is more likely some friend of Lafe Green, for he
probably has some pals that were not caught in the
net of the law when the smugglers were rounded
up.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can do little until we get there and see
what it is all about. There’s nothing to be gained
by idle speculating as to the perpetrator of the
offense, so we might as well take it easy till we
reach our destination,” advised Garry.</p>

<p>The morning dragged on, and the boys welcomed
the half hour stop for dinner. They ate in the
same restaurant where they had met the Customs
man some weeks before.</p>

<p>Their own dinner procured, they got something
for Sandy and carried it to the baggage car.</p>

<p>The dog raised such a howl when they started
to leave that Garry volunteered to ride in the baggage
car for a while, provided the baggageman was
willing. He heartily agreed to allow Garry to remain,
and the others returned to the smoker.</p>

<p>The particular route over which they were traveling was
not one of the best, and occasionally they
were forced to wait while other trains made connections.</p>

<p>About half way though the afternoon, as they
were waiting on a siding to allow a fast freight
from across the border to have right of way, the
boys remarked on the fact that several tramps
seemed to have made a special train of it. They
observed three hanging to the end, grasping the
trainman’s iron rungs for support.</p>

<p>The train had half passed when Dick grasped
Phil by the arm.</p>

<p>“Look quick. There’s one of the tramps that
we caught in our shack at home!”</p>

<p>Phil cast a quick glance and what he saw corroborated
Dick.</p>

<p>“There, I’m glad you saw him too,” announced
Dick, “for I am sure it was one of the gang. If
I alone had seen him, you boys might have said that
I was seeing things. I move we drop out and tell
Garry, and one of us can stay behind with Sandy
and let Garry come back to the car.”</p>

<p>This was done, and Garry was much interested
in their story.</p>

<p>“You remember we saw them in this section once
before, and it is possible they are making a stamping
ground of this place. Now all we need is a
glimpse of LeBlanc and we’ll have all our enemies
with us. We might make a grand slam and clean
them all out.”</p>

<p>Two hours of riding brought them at last to
Hobart, and they gathered their traps and disembarked.</p>

<p>Ruth and her grandfather, John Everett, were
waiting to meet them. Mr. Everett had fully recovered
from his accident with the bear trap, and
both he and his granddaughter greeted the boys
warmly.</p>

<p>“First thing we want is to hear the whole story
and then we will see what we can devise in the way
of plans for putting an end to the annoyance. Shall
we walk towards your house and you can tell us on
the way?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>At the mention of house, both Ruth and her
grandfather looked sad, and Mr. Everett answered
their query about walking in that direction.</p>

<p>“Just now we haven’t any house. It was burned
to the ground last night, and evidence seems to
point to the fact that it was deliberately set on fire!”</p>

<h2 id='chIII'
  class='chapter' title='III. LAFE COMES BACK'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER III</span><br/>
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>LAFE COMES BACK</span>
</h2>

<p>The news shocked the boys into silence for a
moment, then Garry burst out indignantly:</p>

<p>“Well, that’s about the meanest thing I ever
heard of. Are you sure that it was deliberately
fired?”</p>

<p>“We are convinced of it,” said the old man.
“The blaze started in a half a dozen places at the
same time. There was nothing that we could do
to save our home. As a matter of fact, we barely
got out some of our clothes. Of course we have
insurance, but that will never cover the loss of
things that cannot be replaced,—some of my old
books, for instance.”</p>

<p>“It seems likely that the man or men who have
sent the threatening letters are the same who fired
the house,” mused Garry aloud.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Everett, “when we first received
the letters we thought that they might be a practical
joke; and later, when they still continued to come,
we took it to be a means of frightening us. I
thought for a time that it might be some one whose
enmity I had personally incurred, but when Ruth
got them too, with hints as to why they were being
sent, namely, the matter of the smuggling attempt
and capture a short time ago, I knew that it was
some member of the band who was still at large.”</p>

<p>Garry pondered for a moment, Then he remarked:</p>

<p>“There would seem to be only two sources from
which the letters would come. One is from some
friend or friends of Lafe Green, and the other—but
that seems almost impossible.”</p>

<p>“Who are you thinking of?” inquired the old
man quickly.</p>

<p>“Why, I was thinking of Jean LeBlanc,” answered
Garry slowly. “What makes me think that
impossible is that I know where he has been for
some little time, and he doubtless did not send
them, for he was too busy with his other infernal
mischief.”</p>

<p>Ruth then interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p>“Suppose we leave and go to Aunt Abby’s house,
and talk about things, instead of standing here like
a pack of sticks. Aunt Abbie isn’t really our
aunt,” she said, turning to the boys. “She’s an
old lady who lives all alone in a big house, and
occasionally she takes in people to board and room.
That’s where we are staying now.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was voted a sensible one, and
the party proceeded to the house referred to.</p>

<p>There they were met by Aunt Abbie, a little, old,
grey haired person, who beamed when she was introduced
to the boys.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard a lot about you boys from Ruth,” she
told them; “especially about Garry.”</p>

<p>Phil and Dick burst into laughter, which they
choked off as soon as possible, while Garry turned
a fiery red. He knew what was in store for him as
soon as they were alone.</p>

<p>They were ushered into the trim parlor and took
up the conversation where it had been left at the
station.</p>

<p>Ruth’s grandfather asked what the boys knew of
LeBlanc’s latest movements, and this naturally led
to the telling of the occurrences that transpired at
the lumber camp. The boys did not tell this until
they were hard pressed to, for they were modest
when it came to their own achievements. Finally
the story came out, each of the boys telling a portion
of it in turn.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that halfbreed could not have been
at the bottom of this after all. It was only a few
days ago that he came to the camp, and we have
gotten the letters at intervals during the past three
weeks. He could easily have sent them through
some friend. My only hope is that he is not in this
section again, but that arson business was what I
would have expected of a man of his stamp,” concluded
Mr. Everett.</p>

<p>“Wonder if the tramps could have had anything
to do with it? You know the old saying about birds
of a feather flocking together, and it would be like
them to hitch up,” queried Dick.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s possible but not exactly probable,”
said Garry.</p>

<p>“Have you the letters?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re upstairs. Wait a minute and I’ll
run up and get them,” said Ruth; and away she
went to do the errand.</p>

<p>She was back in a few moments and handed them
to Phil. The boys crowded around to see them.
They were all printed in a coarse lettering, mostly
on scraps of old wrapping paper; one was on a
hand-bill, and two or three on a cheap grade of stationery
such as may be bought at any notion store.</p>

<p>The letters were all of the same tenor, warning
the man and girl to leave town at once else misfortune
would visit them.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much of a clue of any sort in the
letters themselves, but let’s see the envelopes; perhaps
they will be more enlightening,” remarked
Garry.</p>

<p>The envelopes were all of the same variety, cheap
and flimsy as was the paper. The postmarks were
varied. Most of them were evidently mailed in
Hobart, but one had come across the border, as its
Canadian stamp bore testimony, and three came
from the little town of Coldenham, several miles up
along the border.</p>

<p>“Not much help in these after all,” said Garry in
a disappointed tone. “We might go to these various
offices and see if the postmasters have any remembrance
of who mailed them, but that is too
faint a clue to waste time following up.”</p>

<p>“Say, here’s something that might help. Just see
how this sentence is worded,” broke in Phil. “‘It
is that the town you must leave immediately.’ Now
no person who was familiar with the English language
would have said it that way. The more likely phrasing
would have been, ‘You must leave town immediately.’
And that makes me certain that only one man wrote
those letters.”</p>

<p>“Jean LeBlanc!” burst out Garry and Dick almost
in the same breath.</p>

<p>“That’s what I think myself. I’d stake a lot that
I am right,” said Phil. He began to look through
the other letters and, as he expected, his scrutiny
revealed several other little oddities of language.</p>

<p>They were still discussing the matter when Aunt
Abbie entered to announce that supper was ready.
The boys protested that they could not put her to
so much trouble, but were instantly hushed by the
old lady.</p>

<p>“She prides herself on her cooking, and you’ll
hurt her feelings if you protest,” whispered Ruth
to the boys, so the party trooped out to the dining
room where an ample supper was waiting them.</p>

<p>As they ate, the question of quarters for the
night came up, and Garry suggested that they go to
the lean-to which they had built in the woods outside
of the town on their previous visit; but Aunt
Abbie would not hear of this, and insisted that they
stay there.</p>

<p>“Land sakes, I have enough room here for all of
you, and I like to have people in this big, lonely
house. Keeps me young to have young people
around me, too.”</p>

<p>So it was settled that they should stay there for
the night, but the boys decided that in the morning
they would visit the lean-to, and repair any slight
damage that might have been done to it, and make
their quarters there during their stay, for they
thought they might be in and out a good deal in
search for the writer of the threatening letters.</p>

<p>After supper Dick announced that in the morning
he was going to try his hand at photographing the
letters. This led to another examination of the
notes, and Garry made a discovery.</p>

<p>“Look, there is a distinct sign of a fingerprint
here. The paper looks as though it might at one
time have been wrapped around a piece of bacon
and is slightly greasy; enough to take a fingerprint.
When you take your pictures in the morning, Dick,
I will fix it so the print will show up.”</p>

<p>Supper over, the boys decided to walk to the
postoffice and interview the postmaster, whose name
they found out was Denton. They also ascertained
that he had held this position for nearly twenty
years.</p>

<p>The postoffice was located in the general store,
where they had often purchased provisions while
on the trail of the smugglers. Denton was soon
found, and the boys proceeded to recall themselves
to him. He greeted them warmly and asked if they
were on another camping trip. This last was accompanied
by a sly wink, for naturally he had
heard of the part they had played in running down
Lafe Green and his gang. He showed no surprise
when the boys asked if they could hold a private
conversation with him.</p>

<p>Denton led the way back to a little cubby hole of
an office, furnished only with a desk and a fair-sized
safe. In this, the boys judged, he kept stamps
and the records of the postoffice, as well as what
money he took in during the day’s trading at the
store.</p>

<p>Garry briefly explained what their purpose in
coming back to Hobart was, and exhibited the letter
sent by the Chief Ranger as authority for their
statements.</p>

<p>Denton glanced at the letter and then leaned
back in his chair.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you all there is to tell. I suppose
you’ve seen the letters that contained the
threats, and if you can figure out who sent them,
it’s more than I can do. Just probably a case of
spite against ’em, and will doubtless blow over.
I’ve always held to the opinion that barking dogs
never bite.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me that the dog bit this time,” remarked
Garry dryly.</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Why, the setting afire of the house last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that. Well, there may be other reasons.
Mr. Everett has a whole lot of enemies. He’s
pretty freespoken with his tongue. ’Course he’s
generally right in what he says, but there’s nothing
that hurts like the truth in some cases. All that’s
a matter for the sheriff to help out with. On the
big matter we can’t do anything till the postoffice
inspector gets here. I’m expecting he’ll arrive
some time tomorrow, next day at the latest,” said
Denton.</p>

<p>The boys looked up in surprise. The “other
matter” was a new one on them.</p>

<p>Garry looked at Denton, and in a rather bewildered
tone asked:</p>

<p>“What other matter?”</p>

<p>This time it was Denton’s turn to look surprised.</p>

<p>“Seems to me that is the thing we have to worry
about. I don’t know as I ought to say anything
more about it to you. ’Course I figure you’re all
right, but you should know about that if you’re
going to help out on it.”</p>

<p>Garry spent a few moments in argument, and
finally convinced Denton that they were all right in
this matter, and at last, after giving the subject
several moments of thought, he enlightened them.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m referring to the robbery of the mail
that goes to the paper mill!”</p>

<p>The trio looked aghast at this piece of news.
This was a brand new angle to them, and they
pressed the postmaster to give them the details.</p>

<p>“There ain’t much to tell. You probably know
there’s a pulp mill up the line aways at Coldenham.
The owner is a queer old cuss; Scotch feller name
of Ferguson. He’s pretty near the richest man in
this neck o’ the woods and peculiar in lots of ways.
Has this big pulp mill, but won’t have a business
office in Portland or Boston, but does everything
from the mill there. Owns the bank in the town,
too, so all his money goes through there. Now all
mail that goes to Coldenham from round Boston or
New York comes through this office. Mostly always
it lays over a bit in this office, for the only
railroad between here and Coldenham is a short
haul road that’s owned by Ferguson; more money
for him you see. We get the mail on the regular
mail train here and then transfer it and send it
along to him. Once in a while his mail comes too
late to catch the return trip of his train and then
we send it along to him by a flivver. Have a regular
rural carrier here that does that extra.</p>

<p>“Well, everything has always gone along all right
until a couple of weeks or so ago, the mail was
rifled somewhere between its starting point and its
destination. ’Course there is no way of telling right
now just where this was done, but when the inspector
comes we can put a check on it from office
to office and see at just what point it was robbed.
Most of the stuff has been checks, certified of
course, and so it’s done by someone that knows how
to cash them after they are taken.</p>

<p>“There’s the story in a nutshell. If you can make
anything out of it, you’re a better man than I am,
any one of you.”</p>

<p>Denton concluded his story and leaned back in
his chair surveying the boys.</p>

<p>Garry was silent for a few moments, and then
he made answer:</p>

<p>“I am afraid there is nothing that we can do.
When the inspector comes we can do anything that
he asks and guide him around through the country
and that is about all. We are just Rangers and not
postoffice detectives.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing I can do except sit tight
and see that it doesn’t disappear while it’s in this
office. I wouldn’t have that happen for the world.
I’ve been postmaster here for nigh onto twenty
year, and never was so much as a postage stamp
short in all that time,” said Denton with an air of
pride.</p>

<p>As they talked, Phil had been listening intently.
He possessed an almost abnormal hearing, and had
frequently heard things that warned of the approach
of danger when his two chums could not
hear a sound.</p>

<p>“Keep on talking, Garry,” he whispered to his
chum, who happened to be sitting nearest him.
“Talk loudly.”</p>

<p>Then stepping cautiously, so as to make no
sound, he approached the window, which was up
on account of the heat of the night, and with a
quick snap of his hand, caused the roller shade to
fly to the top.</p>

<p>All present got a glimpse of the face of a man
standing there at the window, listening to the conversation.
The chums made a dash for the window
and were fumbling at the screen when the man
fled.</p>

<p>“By gosh, that’s Pete Avalon, one of the hangers
on at the restaurant kept by the big Frenchman
where you fellows have eaten, and where, if I remember
rightly, one of you had an unpleasant experience
a while ago.”</p>

<p>“Now what was he there for if not to listen to
the particular conversation that we were having?”
asked Garry of the others. “I begin to make two
and two into four on several of these questions. I
think that the sending of the letters to the Everetts
and the theft of the checks from the mail are done
by the same people.”</p>

<p>“By gracious, there’s something I noticed when
we were examining the letters and then it slipped
my mind. There was one letter there that had no
stamp on it, and I was going to ask how it had
been delivered. I’ll bet a cookie that it was slipped
into the mail bag by someone who was fooling
around with the other mail. Now this Avalon has
probably hot-footed it to the man back of all this
to tell him that the law is already on the trail of
the missing checks. They know that you can fool
very little with Uncle Sam’s mail system. It’s one
of the safest and best protected things in the
world,” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“Well, we can do nothing more tonight, except
to notify the constable to keep an eye on Avalon,
and pick him up on suspicion for questioning when
the inspector gets here. We might as well go and
get some sleep now, and be fresh for a start in the
morning,” said Garry.</p>

<p>“Not much use in having Avalon watched. Now
that he knows he was seen, he is probably off to
some hiding place where he will lie low till he can
get across the border. Still we’d better be safe than
sorry, and I’ll tell the authorities first thing in the
morning,” said Denton.</p>

<p>The boys took their leave of Denton and left the
general store, promising to look in next morning
and buy some supplies, for they intended to camp
at the old lean-to outside the town.</p>

<p>They stood for a few moments on the steps of
the general store chatting with several of the villagers
who made a sort of a club room of the store
every evening. Then they walked down the street
a way, when Garry stopped them for a consultation.</p>

<p>“I was just wondering if there was anything that
we could do tonight,” he told his friends. “I
thought for a minute that we might try and get on
the trail of this Avalon and see where he went. If
he is mixed up in this, he probably went directly to
where the head of this mischief is and reported his
discovery.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe there is a chance in the world.
He went off as though he were shot out of a gun,
and by now he is probably safely hidden or making
his way guardedly to his hiding place. If we had
brought Sandy with us tonight he might have gotten
on the trail. Next time we make any move,
we’ll have him with us,” advised Dick.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right, and the sensible thing to do
is to go home to bed,” answered Garry. They
sauntered up the street towards the section where
Aunt Abbie lived, taking their time, for the night
was fine—a night such as is known only in Maine—when
the heat of the day is cooled off by the balsam
laden breezes that blow through the forests.</p>

<p>“Say, I want some candy before I go to bed,”
announced Garry.</p>

<p>“Gosh, and you holler at me because I want to
eat things now and then,” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“It’s mostly now with you Dick, and in my case
it happens to be then. You boys walk on ahead
and I’ll trot back to Denton’s and get a little. I
won’t be more than five minutes and will catch up
with you by the time you reach Aunt Abbie’s
house,” and Garry was off at a trot for the store.</p>

<p>He procured his candy, and was walking back to
join his comrades, when he became suddenly aware
that he was being followed.</p>

<p>Garry could not see anyone, but he had that instinct
that comes to anyone when he is being followed.
It is the same feeling that one has when he
realizes that there is someone else in a room with
him when it was supposed to be empty.</p>

<p>He dodged behind a tree, and made a noise of
tramping with his feet as though he were still moving
on.</p>

<p>This ruse succeeded, and he saw a man dodging
from tree to tree. Garry left his shelter and turned
the corner into the street that led to Aunt Abbie’s
house, and there stepped quickly into the shadow
cast by a large elm tree. The electric light on the
street was a wretched affair, casting only a few
feeble rays on the street below.</p>

<p>As he waited, a figure turned the corner, and
with a start he recognized Lafe Green.</p>

<p>Garry was undecided as to what course he would
pursue. Should he call to his friends to come back
and join him, and see if they could not bring Lafe
back to justice, or should he see if he couldn’t shake
him off and then turn pursuer himself and see where
Lafe would go?</p>

<p>Green, however, decided matters for him. Evidently
he had discerned what Garry was up to, for
when he reached the tree behind which Garry was
concealed, he darted around and came face to face
with the boy.</p>

<p>Garry put on a bold front, although inwardly he
was a little troubled over what might be the outcome
of this meeting.</p>

<p>“Hello, Lafe,” said the boy. “How do you happen
to be here?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know as it’s any of your particular business,
but before you go trying any funny business.
I’ll tell you that I am out on bail, so you have nothing
on me at all.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been following you about, though, for the
last few minutes, to get a chance to tell you something.
Unless you fellows get out of here by tomorrow
night, I promise you that you will be driven
out in a way that will make you sorry you ever
came here. Get that?”</p>

<h2 id='chIV'

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER IV</span><br/>
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE GUM HUNTER’S CLUE</span>
</h2>

<p>With these words, Lafe turned and walked
swiftly away, leaving Garry standing there dumbfounded
for the moment. There was much food
for thought in what Green had just said. In the
first place, Garry had little idea that he would see
Green at all, and could not understand how he had
gotten bail for his freedom. Then came the recollection
that the man had several friends around this
particular section, and undoubtedly had quite a little
money himself, made out of some of his illegal practices,
such as the smuggling at which he had been
caught only a comparatively short time ago.</p>

<p>The threat of harm did not worry Garry particularly.
He and his chums had so often been in
tangles that it did not faze him.</p>

<p>What did cause him the most concern was why
Lafe should want them to leave town. Of course
he would be vengeful about the part they played in
his arrest, but that would hardly make him follow
them and give a specific warning.</p>

<p>Lafe and LeBlanc had been mixed up in the
smuggling plot, and to Garry it required no great
stretch of the imagination to figure that they might
again be working in cahoots.</p>

<p>There was no particular use in following him,
since he would probably go to his home, and had
possibly been seen by some of the people in the
town.</p>

<p>Deciding that he could do nothing, Garry hastened
homeward, and found that his friends had
already arrived. They asked him what had kept
him so long, and he exploded a bombshell under
their feet when he told them of his meeting with
Green.</p>

<p>“Now if we find out anything that connects the
tramps with this outfit as I suggested a while ago,
we’ll have a pretty pack of villains, won’t we?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the tramps have anything to do
with this, much as you’d like to have it so, Dick,”
said Garry.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing we might do a bit later if we
deem it advisable,” suggested Phil, “and that’s make
a little tour of investigation of Green’s house as you
did last time, Garry. We know of the secret
entrance to the house, and that would simplify getting
inside.”</p>

<p>“We’d have to have pretty good clues to make us
do that again,” decided Garry. “That last time
was a pretty risky piece of business, and luck was
with us all the time. However, we shall see what
later developments will bring about. Now I move
we say goodnight and crawl off to bed.”</p>

<p>Ruth had been an interested listener all this time,
and she implored the boys to let her help if they
would.</p>

<p>“I’d just love to think that I helped in any way
to round up the people that have been sending those
horrid letters,” she said with bated breath.</p>

<p>The boys laughed, and assured her that if they
could use her in any way to play detective they
would surely call on her. They said nothing concerning
the new developments in the postal situation,
deeming it wiser to keep this matter a secret
until the arrival of the inspector.</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast they set about taking
photographs of the letters. They did not think
it highly necessary that this be done, but there was
little they could do until the arrival of the man from
the postoffice department, and besides, Dick was
anxious to try out his skill as a photographer. He
was fairly adept already, and was always trying to
add to his experience.</p>

<p>“Now how are you going to treat that fingerprint,
Garry?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“I won’t promise that it will be altogether successful;
all I know about doing it is something I
read in a newspaper once. It seems that the way
they photograph prints is to cover the spot with
some specially prepared dark powder and that
catches on the ridges of the print left by the finger.
Now we haven’t any of that particular kind of
powder, so we’ll have to invent something.”</p>

<p>“Let Uncle Dudley here come to bat with a
bright suggestion,” said Phil. “Suppose we just
take an ordinary lead pencil and scrape on the lead
until we have sufficient powder for the purpose?”</p>

<p>“Fine. I believe that will do the trick,” responded
Garry.</p>

<p>A pencil was quickly procured and Garry scraped
a little heap of graphite powder while Dick prepared
to take the pictures.</p>

<p>He procured a board and tacked the letters on it,
and then set it against the house where the bright
sunlight would strike it with full force.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give this a time exposure,” he
told the boys. “This kind of work is generally
done with artificial light, using an extra powerful
bulb; but I think with this bright sunlight and a
time exposure instead of a snapshot, we will be able
to do a good job.”</p>

<p>Dick snapped the various letters, all except the
one with the greasy imprint on it. This was held to
the last, and when he was ready the board was laid
flat while Garry sprinkled the powder on the print.
Then the board was tilted so that all the surplus
scrapings would slide off, leaving only those that
adhered to the ridges. They were delighted when
they found that they could almost make out the
complete design of the print.</p>

<p>“I’m no judge of such matters, but I venture to
say that there’s enough of a print there for any
purposes of identification. Snap away,” said Garry.</p>

<p>Aunt Abbie and Ruth and her grandfather had
been interested spectators during this operation, and
as soon as the photographing of the letters was completed,
Ruth asked if the boys would not take a
snapshot of the entire group.</p>

<p>Dick said he would be glad to, and was arranging
the members of the little party in a compact
group, when the gate was opened and a man
walked up the path. He was a lean, sallow looking
man, and as he observed the three boys, he said:</p>

<p>“Am I right in supposing that one of you is
Garry Boone?”</p>

<p>Garry stepped forward and said that was his
name.</p>

<p>“My name is Simmons, and I’m from the postoffice
department.”</p>

<p>Here was the expected inspector, and the boys
crowded forward to shake hands with him. Garry
acted as master of ceremonies, and introduced all
the party to Simmons.</p>

<p>“We’re whiling away a few minutes taking pictures.
Won’t you step in and we’ll have a complete
group; a regular illustration for ‘The Mystery
of the Threatening Letters,’” said Dick with
a laugh.</p>

<p>Simmons appeared to hesitate for a moment, and
then with a smile stepped in beside Aunt Abbie and
in another minute the picture was snapped.</p>

<p>The boys neglected to mention the fact that they
had taken pictures of the letters—not meaning to
conceal anything—but they were eager to have Simmons
go with them to the postoffice where they
could begin work on the mystery.</p>

<p>Simmons went into the house to question Mr.
Everett, and while he was talking, Dick removed
the letters from the board and gave them to Ruth
to carry to Simmons. They followed in a few
moments, as soon as Dick had taken out the film,
which had been exhausted, and substituted a new
one for more snaps.</p>

<p>“I’ll take charge of these letters,” said Simmons.
“I don’t know that you boys can be of a great deal
of help. In fact I am of the opinion that the less
you are seen in connection with the case, the better.
Now I’m going to be perfectly frank with you. I
don’t see why boys were sent to mix in this case at
all. It would have been far better to have me here
alone, where I could work with some of the necessary
secrecy that the case demands. Which reminds
me, also, that no one here is to tell anybody what
my business is.”</p>

<p>This had been delivered in a rather snappy tone,
and the boys were somewhat hurt at the attitude
taken by the inspector.</p>

<p>“Now get us right on this matter, please, Mr.
Simmons. You won’t find us making any silly suggestions
to you how to do your work, and as for
our being here, boys or not, we came simply on the
orders of our superior. We are in the service of
the State of Maine, and as such are bound to obey
orders, whatever duty may be assigned to us. We
were fortunate enough to give some slight assistance
on the other matters here, and it is probably
for that reason that the Chief Ranger had us come
here.”</p>

<p>“Slight assistance indeed,” burst out Ruth.
“Why, Mr. Simmons, they were the only ones that
did anything on that smuggling business. All the
treasury man had to do was bring handcuffs and
arrest the men after the boys had found out who
was in the ring, and everything that had to do with
the fur and diamond smuggling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean that you may not prove to be
of valuable assistance,” Simmons hastened to say.
“I merely thought that I would get a good line on
what is what, and it wouldn’t do for us to be seen
in company too much, for that would tip our hand
to the ones who are stealing the mailed checks.”</p>

<p>This seemed good logic to the boys, and so it
was agreed that the only time they should meet
would be after nightfall and at Aunt Abbie’s home.</p>

<p>Simmons decided to go alone to the postoffice,
and the boys, seeing there was nothing they could
do for the present, determined to get some supplies
and go to their old lean-to and put it in shape for
habitation during their stay in that section.</p>

<p>They procured their groceries and wandered
down the leafy forest lane to their old camping
ground. They found the lean-to in excellent condition.
All that needed to be done was to fix up
stones for their campfire and cut new boughs for a
“mattress” on which to lay their blankets.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this man Simmons?”
asked Dick, as they set out for a little clump of balsams
to get boughs.</p>

<p>“Don’t know just what to say offhand,” answered
Garry. “I can say, however, that he seems to be a
little peeved at our being here to help him out. Of
course I realize that it is a cheeky thing for a pack
of boys to be sent to help a man that knows his
business, or is supposed to know it, but orders are
orders.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it is cheeky; but without being
stuck on ourselves, I don’t think the smuggler band
would have been run down without our help; or
to put it more modestly, without the help of someone
more familiar with the ways of the woods than
a city man from Washington. However, we’ll do
just what he tells us to, and let it go at that,” said
Phil, as he swung his hatchet and knicked off a few
boughs.</p>

<p>“That isn’t my idea at all,” interrupted Dick.
“We will in all probability not be asked to give any
help at all if my impression of this man is correct.
Therefore I move that we do a little work on our
own hook and see what we can do ourselves. If
we find any clue that is really promising, we can
turn it over to Simmons. If he accepts it, all well
and good; we will know that he appreciates the
help. If he doesn’t, we can go on quietly ourselves
and do what we can. If we are fortunate enough
to get the right clue that will lead to the real culprit,
we will offer it to him again. Then if he bars
us and pays no attention to it, the best thing to do
will be to communicate with the Chief Ranger at
Augusta and get his advice as to what to do. How
does that strike you fellows?”</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me,” said Garry, “but I think
you chaps are building a mountain out of a mole
hill. If we find something that means anything, it
will give the inspector a good impression of us, and
we will then be asked to give all the help we can.
However, only a little time will tell what is going
to happen, and the first thing to do is to find some
real evidence that will help the case. Until we do
that we can’t claim to be much good, and I wouldn’t
blame the man for not wanting us to be bothering
around.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, let’s follow our usual custom and
hold a council of war,” suggested Phil, as they
started back to the lean-to with their arms full of
the fragrant balsam boughs.</p>

<p>This suggestion was hailed with delight by the
others, and at the lean-to they made haste to spread
the boughs to that they would make comfortable
bunks, and then sitting Hindu fashion on the
ground between the two branch lean-tos, opened
the council.</p>

<p>Garry was the appointed leader of the boys on
all expeditions. This had held true ever since they
had first become friends, for Garry was a year
older than the others, and possessed of a level head.
His was a forceful personality that made him a
born leader. Yet there was never a complaint on
the part of the others against Garry’s leadership,
for he possessed the fine trait of never being
“bossy.” An important step was always discussed
before a decision was made, and when there was
any doubt, a vote was taken after each man had
had his say. Oftentimes they decided such matters
as who should perform certain duties by drawing
lots, using three twigs, the man getting the shortest
being named for the job.</p>

<p>“All right, now,” said Garry. “Who has suggestion
number one?”</p>

<p>“I believe that I have a hunch,” answered Phil.
“Perhaps I am all wrong and am just trying to
paint a villain blacker than he is; but I cannot get
it out of my head that the halfbreed is mixed up
in this some way. Perhaps he is not the brains of
the organization, but Lafe Green might be. He is
a cunning man, versed in all kinds of villainy, and
with LeBlanc’s bravery, for bad as he is, you must
give him credit for being fearless, they make a
dangerous combination. Lafe Green can command
a certain type of men by holding influence over
them, and LeBlanc can lead certain kinds through
making them fear him. Then they seem to be
mixed up in any mess that we come in contact with.
I move we start on the premise that they are the
ones.”</p>

<p>“Good logic, there,” said Garry, “and there is
only one way to find out whether or not your hunch
is true. That is by following them all and either
pinning something on them, or finding that they are
guiltless.”</p>

<p>“Of all the crowd that we have run afoul of in
the past few weeks,” said Phil, “who is still at
large?”</p>

<p>“Why, let me see,” said Garry. “I can think of
only three. There are the LeBlanc brothers and
Lafe Green. Of course we don’t know how many
confederates there are for this outfit, but there
should not be many. Most of them were cleaned
up at the time of the smuggling. Then, too, this
kind of business is something that does not require
a great deal of help. The threatening letters could
be sent by one man, and the mail robbery would
not need many. I am inclined to think there is
inside help somewhere in that. Yes, there are only
three that I can think of.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, now,” interrupted Dick. “You
forget the tramps.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but I doubt it. There is nothing to
make us think they would have become acquainted
with Green and his outfit, and besides they have seen
us a couple of times and failed to recognize us.
That was natural, because we are dressed differently
and are tanned up so that our own families would
hardly recognize us. If they had been part of the
Green-LeBlanc outfit, they would have been told
of us, and when they saw us would have made it
known in some fashion. I think they are only in
this section because it is close to the border, and
they can keep out of sight. Perhaps they are laying
plans for some sort of a crime around here. At
any rate, it would be well to watch them and if
possible effect their capture, for they are wanted
in Portland for jumping their bail. Well, that
being put aside for the moment, what is our first
step?”</p>

<p>“I suggest first that we have a quiet talk with
Denton, since we were not allowed to be in the conference
between him and Simmons. Then I move
that we take a little trip to Green’s house and try
to get in by way of the secret passage as you did
the other time, Garry,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“That sounds good to me. I think we could do
it, for there was never anything said about our
knowing it. If we had been discovered that time,
they would either have blocked the passage up, or
made some provision for keeping prying people out
when they were holding a conference. Suppose we
set tomorrow night for the trial and draw lots for
the one to go?” offered Garry.</p>

<p>“All right except for one thing,” said Phil. “I
suggest that the lots be drawn only between Dick
and me. You had the thrill and the adventure last
time, so that ought to let you out, Garry.”</p>

<p>“Suits me, but I don’t like to think of you chaps
doing anything as dangerous as that might easily
be, without being in on it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you did your duty the other time, and
there will be no one to say that you are backing
out of danger, for you aren’t. Phil and I are backing
you out ourselves, so you can console yourself
with that thought,” said Dick with a laugh.</p>

<p>The lots were drawn, and to his inward delight,
Dick was the lucky man.</p>

<p>“That seems to be all that we can do for the
present,” remarked Garry. “Suppose we rest a bit
and have dinner, then let Dick take a few pictures
and wander back to town and have a talk with
Denton.”</p>

<p>This was the course agreed upon, and Phil wandered
into the woods in search of squirrels for a
squirrel pie.</p>

<p>He was back in an hour with four beauties, and
Dick was set to skinning while Phil made the necessary
dough for the pie crust.</p>

<p>All busied themselves in the task of preparing
the dinner, and soon it was ready. They had barely
sat down, when a voice startled them.</p>

<p>“M-m-m, that coffee smells powerful good,” said
the voice, and the boys looked up to see a man
standing near them.</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t our old friend, the gum hunter,”
cried Garry.</p>

<p>And so it was. The gum hunter; meaning a
man who made a part of his living by wandering
through the woods collecting spruce gum to sell to
the drug stores throughout the state, who had made
their acquaintance on their previous visit and at
that time had given them a tip that stared them on
the quest of the smugglers that had ended so successfully.</p>

<p>“Sit in and have pot luck with us,” invited Dick.</p>

<p>“Don’t know but what I will; was getting pretty
hungry, and since I was round near, thought I’d
come here and fix myself some lunch. Often come
here because I can build a campfire at the same
place, and generally have a few old branches cut to
use. Two or three times I’ve slept here to save
bother of going all the way back to town, especially
when I wanted an early start in the morning,” said
the gum hunter.</p>

<p>They finished their dinner, and were about to
clean up, when the gum hunter bade them wait.</p>

<p>“Callate I’ll have to furnish something towards
this eatin’,” he told them, and carefully delving
into his pack brought forth a flat package. “This
is a home-made apple pie, and I hope ’tain’t
squashed up much, though I bin carryin’ it since
morning. That’ll cut four ways, and make good
big pieces. ’Tain’t none of your miserable little
bakery pies.”</p>

<p>“Gosh,” said Dick, “that’s just what I need to
top off my dinner. Garry, pass the coffeepot.”</p>

<p>“Now what might you boys be doing back here?
Setting out to catch more smugglers? Saw Lafe
Green in town again last night, and wherever he
is there’s bound to be contraband running across
the border.”</p>

<p>The boys knew that the old man was reliable and
trustworthy, and one who could be relied upon not
only to keep a tight mouth about any confidence
that was given him, but one who could give sound
advice when occasion demanded it.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Garry sketched briefly the
main points in the matter that brought them back
to Hobart and its vicinity.</p>

<p>“M-m-m, now, that requires considerable
thought,” said the old woodsman. “This matter
of the mail robbery is somethin’ new to me. Guess
naturally the postoffice kept mighty quiet about that.
’Course I know about the letters, saw one of them.
That’s something I’d put right at Lafe Green’s
door, and where he is, there’s the halfbreed to consider
also. Lafe has always had it in for Everett,
and especially since the smugglin’ business; for
everyone round here knows that you chaps were in
on it, and your bein’ friendly with Mr. Everett has
given rise to pretty good guesses that he helped
you out. That was to be expected, his having been
in the Customs service so long. But this other
matter, I can’t say anything about till I think it
over.”</p>

<p>“We have had some idea that someone along the
line in the postoffices might have helped out. Otherwise
this could not have been done unless the mail
carriers were held up at the point of a gun and
robbed,” said Garry. “What about Postmaster
Denton?”</p>

<p>“Honest as the day is long,” promptly returned
the gum hunter. “I’d trust him with anythin’ I
have, and there ain’t a soul in Hobart that wouldn’t
do the same thing.”</p>

<p>“That seems to let him out, then,” said Garry.
“Now are we crazy and stretching things when we
figure that Green may have something to do with
this?”</p>

<p>“Yep, seems to be stretching it a little bit, but I
wouldn’t put it past him. Let me light up and
think this out for a minute.”</p>

<p>So saying, George Washington Dudley—for that
was the name of the hunter—although he insisted
that his friends call him “Dud,” hauled out an old
pipe and was soon puffing ruminatively away at it.</p>

<p>“If this thing was done with the help of any of
the postoffice men, it ought not to be a hard matter
to trace it down,” suggested Garry. “How about
the man who delivers the mail with the flivver to
Coldenham when the pulp mill owner’s private road
isn’t running?”</p>

<p>“He’s all right, cousin o’ mine; bank on his being
honest,” returned Dud.</p>

<p>He was silent a minute and then burst out:</p>

<p>“By ginger, it’s funny I didn’t think o’ that before.
Find out one thing, and you’ll have a good
start. Find out if the robberies happen to the mail
that is delivered by my cousin or on the train that
runs between Hobart and Coldenham, and there’s
your start.”</p>

<p>“Why, how will that help us?” inquired Garry.</p>

<p>“Why, dad blame it, the engineer o’ that train is
a brother-in-law of Lafe Green!”</p>

<p>This surprising piece of news threw all into a
silence for a moment.</p>

<p>“You see how simple things are now?” queried
Dud. “If you can find out that letters are all right
when they leave the Hobart postoffice, and are all
wrong when they get delivered to Coldenham, then
you have half the work done, and you can be pretty
certain that Lafe is back of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s step number one, then,” said Garry.
“Let’s hustle back to town and have a little chat
with Denton. Which way are you bound, Dud?”</p>

<p>“I’m off for about two or three days in the
woods. Need some money and so can’t afford to
loaf; besides, these be great days for wandering
through the forest, and can’t afford to miss one of
’em. We’re due for good weather for a week or
two, then we’re due for a spell o’ rainy days. All
signs pint that way. So good luck to you. I’ll
look ye up when I get back, either here or in town.
Ought to catch you one place or t’other.”</p>

<p>Dud shouldered his pack, and loped off into the
woods with a wave of his hand at the chums, and
soon disappeared from view.</p>

<p>The boys hastened to straighten out the camp
after their dinner and then prepared to go to town.</p>

<p>“What say we do same as we did last time—cache
the foodstuff in one of the trees near here; that will
prevent any marauder from making off with it, and
leaving us hungry some night?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Garry. “We can use the
same tree, since it is already marked so we can
readily recognize it.”</p>

<p>This was done and the trio proceeded townwards.
Arriving at the postoffice they found Denton sitting
on the wide porch that stretched for the full length
of the store, gossiping with several old men of the
village.</p>

<p>He hailed the boys as he saw them approach, and
when they climbed up onto the porch invited them
to come inside.</p>

<p>He led the way back to his little cubbyhole office,
and when they were seated, asked what luck they
had had.</p>

<p>Garry replied that little had been done and little
could be until they had asked him some questions.</p>

<p>“First thing,” said the leader of the Rangers,
“has Simmons, the inspector, been here yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, drat him, only left a little while ago,” was
the sour reply.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Garry in surprise,
at the tone of Denton’s voice.</p>

<p>“Seems to think I know all about this matter, and
says he thinks half the trouble is right here. Asked
a lot of fool questions about the letters sent to the
Everetts and darn few about the stolen mail.
Seemed to be most interested in the contents of the
safe. Made me check over all the stamps and the
cash of the postoffice, and wanted to know how
much money was generally kept there, and if it was
cared for safely, and all that sort of stuff. Seems
kind of funny he’d be worried more about a couple
or three hundred dollars of postoffice money than
about Ferguson’s missing checks, which now total
up nearly three thousand dollars. I think he has an
idea I’ve stolen the dratted checks myself.”</p>

<p>The boys did not pay too serious attention to
Denton’s tirade against the inspector, for they
thought that his brusque manner, a little of which
had been displayed to them, had riled the postmaster.</p>

<p>Dick said so in as many words, and laughed a
little at Denton’s ruffled feelings. “What did he
say about us?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, young feller, you think I’m put out at the
way Simmons talked to me, here’s a little for yourself.
He told me not to have anything to do with
that parcel o’ dime novel reading boys that had
come to town to tell the postoffice how to run its
business. So there’s one for you!”</p>

<p>This time it was Dick’s turn to be ruffled, and in
fact so were his chums.</p>

<p>“It’s plain to be seen that there can be little cooperation
between us and the inspector,” said Garry
after everyone had cooled down a trifle. “I think
we had better proceed in our own way, being ready
of course to do anything that Simmons asks us to
do. Now, if you feel that you can give us any private
information, Mr. Denton, we’d be glad to have
it. We have one clue now that may be worth following.
Can you tell us when most of the letters
that contain the checks are delivered and how?”</p>

<p>“Surely can,” answered Denton. “They’re registered,
and generally come in on the noon train
that goes across the border. That has most of the
mail from the big cities. Most of the mail that
comes on the local trains is only from Bangor and
smaller towns along the way. That means that it’s
delivered on Ferguson’s one-horse train. We call it
the creeper around here, it’s so wheezy and slow.
It comes in mornings dragging a load of pulp which
is generally left in the storehouse that Ferguson
has here until he gets a sizable amount, then a
freight train takes it from here to the paper mills
down the line. Late afternoon it makes a return
trip.”</p>

<p>“I always aim to put the registered mail and most
of the Ferguson mail on that train, for the carrier
doesn’t start until later than the train.”</p>

<p>Garry looked significantly at his pals, and warned
them with a look to let him do all the talking.</p>

<p>“What makes you ask about that?” asked Denton.</p>

<p>“Why, we only have a hunch that it would be a
good thing to check the deliveries along the route
and see if there is any way of ascertaining where the
letters might be opened,” answered Garry, who
decided that they had better keep their ideas to
themselves for a while, until they found there was
basis for suspicion, or else found they were on a
wild goose chase. If the latter were the case, they
did not want everyone to laugh at them for their
foolish hunch.</p>

<p>The answer seemed to satisfy Denton, and he
said:</p>

<p>“As for giving you boys any help, you can count
on me every minute. I know what you chaps have
done, and I kinder like you, and I don’t like that
man Simmons at all. In fact if he don’t show some
signs of life and do something after he’s been here
for a reasonable time, I am going to write the
department and ask that another inspector be sent
that won’t bother about the stamps, which have a
regular inspection every so often, and will put his
time in on the right matter.”</p>

<p>There was nothing further that the boys could
ask then, so they went out into the store.</p>

<p>“Better buy something so that we will seem to
have a purpose in coming to the store other than
our real one,” whispered Phil to Garry.</p>

<p>Garry nodded his head, and for the benefit of
those who were sitting out on the porch and who
he knew were probably inveterate gossipers, they
made a few minor purchases, leaving them to be
called for on their way back to the lean-to.</p>

<p>Then they went to Aunt Abbie’s to see their
friends, and found that Mr. Everett was out but
that Ruth was at home. She greeted them with
sparkling eyes, and her whole manner indicated
the she had some very important secret or idea in
her keeping. The boys could not help but notice
this, and pressed her to tell them what she was so
excited about.</p>

<p>The girl, however, steadfastly refused to divulge
her thoughts, and seeing that she had made them
curious to a great degree, teased them considerably
about what she called “womanish curiosity.”</p>

<p>It was well along in the afternoon by now, and
the boys, refusing Aunt Abbie’s pressing invitation
to stay for supper, withdrew to make their way
back to their camp. They wanted to talk over the
new angle in the case, which might mean a trip to
Coldenham first, rather than a search of Lafe
Green’s house. That could probably come later.</p>

<p>They arrived at camp just before dusk and set
about the routine of preparing the evening meal.
As the boys worked, Dick remarked that he did not
think he had enough boughs for a bed, as he was
heavier than the others and would sink in them
much more easily.</p>

<p>The chums laughed at this, and Dick retorted:</p>

<p>“Go on, just because you skinny fellows can sleep
on two branches and a stone is no reason I should
be uncomfortable. Go on, start the supper while I
get some more boughs.”</p>

<p>“How about you helping out a little on the supper?”
queried Phil.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. You get the supper
and let me get some more stuffing for under my
blanket, and I’ll wash the dishes.”</p>

<p>This announcement was like a thunderbolt, for
Dick hated dish washing above anything else. He
would cut wood or carry water or cook without a
murmur, but dish washing drew one constant grumble
from him.</p>

<p>“Gosh, Garry, let him get all the boughs he wants.
When Dick offers voluntarily to wash the dishes,
it’s a day to celebrate. By the way, Dick, you
might bring a few extra ones for me while you’re
at it.”</p>

<p>“Dick must be sick or something,” laughed
Garry, as he watched the fat boy depart.</p>

<p>In a short time Dick came struggling back under
a load of boughs, and as supper was not yet ready,
decided to re-arrange his bunk while waiting. He
went into the lean-to and kicked away the boughs
he had already placed.</p>

<p>Then his chums were startled out of a year’s
growth by hearing him utter a piercing scream.</p>

</h2>

<p>With the scream still ringing in their ears,
Garry and Phil dashed into the lean-to to discover
Dick staring spellbound at the ground.</p>

<p>“Look,” he gasped.</p>

<p>The boys cast their eyes on the ground, and beheld
a big rattlesnake, stone dead.</p>

<p>“Did you kill it, Dick?” was Garry’s first question.</p>

<p>“No, it was laying there under the boughs that
made my sleeping place. Gosh, it scared me, I can
tell you. I don’t know what made me scream so.
I guess it was just the thought that it might have
been alive, and that I would have laid down there
tonight. I saw that it was dead, of course, the
minute I looked at it, but I couldn’t help letting out
that yelp. Ugh, it makes me creep now to think of
it. Wonder how it chose that place to die?”</p>

<p>“Must have crawled in and then gave up the
ghost,” said Phil.</p>

<p>In the meantime Garry had been examining the
reptile’s body.</p>

<p>“That snake was killed by a human being,” he
announced. “See, its head is crushed, and it has
been hit several times with a club. Don’t see how
it could have crawled very far after being mashed
up that way.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” was the startled question
of Dick.</p>

<p>“Looks suspiciously like an ill-timed practical
joke to me,” answered Garry. “Of course it is
foolish to think we are the only ones that ever
come near here, and some passerby or camper might
have killed it and seeing that this place was occupied,
hidden it there to do just what it did—scare
one of us half to death. Any snake is bad enough,
but a rattler, even a dead one, is enough to shake
anyone’s nerve for a minute.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s throw the thing away and forget
about it,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“I think I remember Dud say once that among
his many occupations and ways of making a living
in the woods, was by skinning a snake whenever he
happened to kill one, and selling the skin. There
are some people who want such things for curios,
but blessed if I would want one,” said Dick.
“Chuck it outside and next time we see him we can
tell him he can have it.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if Dud would have done that for a
joke,” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“I doubt that,” said Garry. “Dudley is too sensible
a person to play a fool trick like that, knowing
how it would startle anyone. No, whoever did that
was half foolish. Gosh, there’s the coffee boiling
over,” and Garry dashed to the campfire. They
forbore talking about the snake during supper, and
were about to forget it, when Garry looked at his
chums with a gleam of understanding.</p>

<p>“Listen, you two. I may be wrong, but am more
likely right. I just happened to remember something
that gives me the creeps. If I’m right, it is
the most dastardly attempt to kill a person that I
ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, don’t give a lecture; tell us what you
mean,” broke in Dick.</p>

<p>“It’s just this. That dead rattler was put there
with a distinct purpose by some one who wants us
out of the way!”</p>

<p>“You don’t think anyone is foolish enough to
believe that a dead reptile would drive us away do
you? Of course we would be startled, but it
wouldn’t make us run out of the country,” scoffed
Phil.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t get the point at all,” said Garry,
his face paling at the thought. “Haven’t you ever
heard that the mate of a dead snake will always find
the body and wait there, sometimes for days? It
must be some instinct that makes it think the killer
of its mate will come that way, and enable him to
get revenge.”</p>

<p>The truth of this sank in with such appalling suddenness
that the boys were speechless for a moment.</p>

<p>When at last Dick found his voice, he said in a
trembling tone that he tried to conceal but could
not:</p>

<p>“Why, that means that I might have been bitten
as I slept tonight; and not only that, but all three
of us might have met the same fate. Who do you
suppose was at the bottom of that attempt on our
lives?”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Garry grimly, “I can think of
only one person who would have been fiendish
enough to do that, let alone think of it. It’s an old
Indian trick to get rid of an enemy without leaving
a trace. Boys, just as sure as we’re sitting here,
Jean LeBlanc is back on our trail, and that snake
was put there by none other than our halfbreed
enemy!”</p>

<p>“That means step carefully every minute then,
doesn’t it?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“You bet it does,” responded Garry. “From
now on we go back to our old system of night
watches. Two hours and a half of duty for each
of us every night while we are in the woods, and
eyes in the back of our heads all the time.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Lafe Green could have done
that?” queried Phil. “You know he gave a pretty
significant warning to you last night, Garry.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe he would have thought of
that, and besides he was around town all day, as
you will remember Denton told us when we asked
him. It means that LeBlanc has come back and
they have joined forces.”</p>

<p>The chums carefully searched every nook and
corner of the lean-to, and shook out the boughs that
made their bunks, for they did not know what other
infernal contrivance their enemies might have laying
in wait for them.</p>

<p>It was also agreed to keep the campfire going all
through the night, the boy being on sentry duty
being detailed to keep it supplied with fuel. To
this end, all hands turned out for a few minutes
and gathered firewood. A sharp watch was kept
for the mate of the rattler, and before turning in,
it was carried several feet away from the camp, and
thrown at the foot of a tree.</p>

<p>“You know I have an idea that whoever did that,
or rather say LeBlanc, since we are morally certain
it was his work, will come back here tomorrow to
see if his ruse worked. If he finds us gone, he will
be likely to look under the boughs to see if the
reptile is still there. Now we are not certain that it
is LeBlanc or Green, it may be someone else. In
that case we would want to know what he looked
like. So here is my idea. Just before we leave in
the morning, I am going to rig up a camera trap,”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“A what?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Camera trap; haven’t you ever heard of one?
They’re often used in the woods by people who
want to get good pictures of wild animal life. You
just fix a place for the camera and focus it on a
spot, then set a trap that will pull down the lever
when it is stepped on or moved. Simple as A B C.
I’ve never done it before, but I know how to construct
one. We’ll do it first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p>By this time it had become quite dark, and the
boys turned in, except for Phil, who drew the first
tour of sentry duty. Warning him to keep his eyes
and ears open every minute, Garry and Dick rolled
into their blankets.</p>

<p>Phil was as restless as a cat on a hot plate.
Every snapping twig or soughing of the breeze
through the trees made him jump. He made constant
patrols around the lean-to, snapping on his
pocket electric light as soon as he got out of the
range of the light afforded by the campfire.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, developed during his watch,
and it was with a bit of relief that the end of the
two and a half hour period came. He awakened
Garry, who was to take the second watch, and soon
was curled up in his blanket and fast asleep.</p>

<p>Garry felt much the same as Phil had, although
he took things easier, for he was not of the sensitively
nervous type as was Phil.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he too was glad to call Dick. It
was not that the boys were in any way cowards, for
they were not. Had it been a human being whom
they expected, they would have thought nothing of
it; rather they would have considered it a welcome
bit of excitement. But this was an entirely different
matter—a creeping enemy that would come on them
unawares, and which was more dangerous than
human being or animal could have been.</p>

<p>Dick yawned and grumbled when Garry shook
him, then he rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, and
looked to see that his rifle was in good working
order.</p>

<p>“Anything stirring?” he asked, as Garry handed
over the electric torchlight to him.</p>

<p>“Nothing breezing yet; keep your eyes peeled,”
whispered Garry.</p>

<p>Dick took a round of the lean-to, then running
true to form, rummaged around till he found a
package of cookies he had bought the previous day,
and munched away at them as he watched. He kept
his eyes glued to the spot where the dead reptile
had been thrown, flashing his light there at momentary
intervals.</p>

<p>Then another thought struck him. He now wondered
whether the snake would go directly to the
body, or whether it would come first to where its
mate had originally been. This made Dick jump to
his feet, for he had been sitting with his back to
the lean-to where his chums were asleep, where he
could watch everything for several feet around in
the gleam of the campfire. He patrolled the camp,
and then came and threw fresh wood on the fire.
As the dry branches caught and burst into a bright
flame, he cast one look at the spot where the dead
snake had been put, then let out a yell, and throwing
his rifle to his shoulder, fired after a hasty but
accurate aim. He emptied the magazine before he
stopped firing.</p>

<p>The shots brought his companions tumbling out
with their rifles.</p>

<p>“What is it Dick?” shouted Garry.</p>

<p>“Gosh, it’s a wonder I had presence of mind
enough to shoot,” shivered Dick. “I looked at the
place once and saw nothing, then made a patrol of
the camp and threw on some more wood. It
couldn’t have been quite five minutes when I looked
at the spot once more, and there, coiled up was a
real live snake. Let’s go over and see if it’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Careful now; throw on some more wood and
get your flashlights out,” ordered Garry. “Dick,
you take the three of them, they’ll give a fine light.
Phil, you and I will take our rifles, and we’ll edge
over there very slowly. Be ready to shoot on the
instant.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Phil. “Bullets won’t always
kill a snake. Get a pole and be ready to
break its spinal cord with a good blow. One can
keep his rifle ready. A rattler can’t strike without
coiling, and if it is alive it’s probably threshing
around from the bullets. Here, grab this heavy
sapling that forms a support for this side of the
lean-to.”</p>

<p>It was only an instant to tear away the pole, and
then with Dick holding the flashlights they advanced
cautiously. When they reached the spot they heard
no warning rattle. The rattle snake never strikes
without first whirring the button-like appendages
on the tail. They looked and saw that Dick’s aim
had been deadly. Dick’s magazine rifle contained
fifteen bullets, and he had emptied the whole of them
at the snake. One had taken deadly effect, smashing
the reptile’s head, and one or more had severed
the spinal column.</p>

<p>“Ugh, that’s over with, unless they bring some
of their cousins and aunts,” said Dick with a little
shudder.</p>

<p>Dick’s remark brought a relief to the tension, and
the others laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“No, it’s all over now,” said Garry. “We’ll
heave these things far into the woods and forget
about it. Mark where we put them and Dud can
have the skins. Now let’s get back to bed. Just
to be safe, however, Dick you finish the night
watch.”</p>

<p>Quiet then reigned in the camp, and Dick waited
contentedly until dawn, when he started the coffee
and then awakened his companions.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast, Dick set about making
his camera trap.</p>

<p>“First thing we must do,” he announced, “is to
make this lean-to so that there is only one entrance.
That’s because I can focus the camera to cover only
so much ground. Best way to do is to lay two or
three more saplings crosswise between the two brush
shacks, and weave some branches on them.”</p>

<p>All three set to work and made the lean-to inaccessible
on one side. This was done by laying four
saplings across the opening and fastening them to
the uprights that held the lean-tos. On these were
hung quantities of branches, which were then
twisted in and out of each other much as one
would weave a basket. This is the usual way to
make a brush house in the woods, and so constructed,
they are easy to make and all right for
good weather. Of course a heavy rain will soon
penetrate, and so they are not generally used for
permanent camps. Still, when they are properly
prepared, and thickly woven, these houses will keep
out an ordinary summer shower.</p>

<p>“There, how’s that for a job?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>“Pretty good, except for one thing. We’ll need
some more branches so as to make that wall extra
thick, because it is in that that I am going to mask
the camera,” answered Dick, who was superintending
the job since it was his idea.</p>

<p>This was soon done, and then they stepped back
and surveyed their handiwork.</p>

<p>“Now what’s the next step?” queried Phil.</p>

<p>“Next thing to do is to dig a shallow trench two
feet square and six to eight inches deep. Only way
I see to do that without a shovel is to use our
hatchets as pickaxes, and then scrape away the dirt
with our hands.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of the trench?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>“You ought to be able to see that without asking
questions. That’s what I’ll use to lay some sort of
a platform on that will cause the lever of the camera
to snap. Thing that stumps me just now is how to
make that platform. Before we cross that bridge,
however, let’s get that trench fixed. On second
thought, it need be only about three inches deep.
I am beginning to see light.”</p>

<p>The work of making the trench was simple, and
when it had been completed, Dick ordered them to
get about a dozen thin saplings.</p>

<p>“Strikes me the fat boy is pretty good at bossing,
isn’t he, Garry?” said Phil with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Go on now, get those saplings. You see before
you a mighty inventor who cannot be bothered with
menial tasks,” said Dick in a lofty tone.</p>

<p>“Don’t know whether to trip him up and sit on
him, or just ignore him,” said Garry to Phil.</p>

<p>Still chaffing good naturedly, the two set out for
the saplings, while Dick busied himself with setting
his camera in the brush, masking it so that only the
lens appeared. Having done this, he stepped away
a few feet and looked to see if it was observable.
He decided that no one could see it without looking
for it especially.</p>

<p>Garry and Phil came back and stood for a moment,
looking straight at the brush screen that had
been erected.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you improve the shining moments
and put your camera in place?” asked Garry as he
saw the closed case lying on the ground.</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Dick delightedly. “It’s there
already, and if you boys who know about it couldn’t
see it, then certainly no one else will. Now for the
trap.”</p>

<p>The making of the trap was a delicate process.
First he took two sticks and laid them crossways
at each end of the trench. Then he anchored these
securely at each end, putting dirt on them and
stamping it down with his heavy shoe packs so that
it would not stir in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>Next he delved into his knapsack and brought out
some strong but thin linen cord they had bought
some time previously and which had served them
well at various times, since it was light enough to
do fairly delicate work with, yet strong enough to
bear some strain. He ran a length of this from the
lever on the camera to a sapling which was laid
across the two supports that he had built. With this
as a guide, he attached a dozen threads a foot or
two from where the nearest sapling began.</p>

<p>The next thing was to run the main string down
and under one of the sapling supports on the brush
screen where the camera was concealed. He
smoothed away the bark from the wood so that the
string would slip easily, and then ran it back up to
the ridge of the lean-to. From there it was brought
across and down to the ground, where the trap was
to be laid.</p>

<p>“You see the idea, now, don’t you?” Dick asked.</p>

<p>“Well, we have vague glimmerings, and that is
all,” answered Garry, speaking for himself and Phil.</p>

<p>“The thing is simple enough. This cord has been
brought around so that it is attached to the lever
and to this trap. When someone steps on the trap,
it will sink just enough to pull on the cord, and that
will bring down the lever, and presto, your picture
is taken.”</p>

<p>“Well, I see that,” said Garry, “but what’s to
prevent its taking another picture when someone
steps on it again?”</p>

<p>“Easy again. Once the camera has been snapped
by the trap, its work is done. You see the lever on
this camera takes one picture when you pull down,
then to get another, you push the lever back up.
Of course there is nothing in this crude trap that
will push up, so you can take only one picture without
resetting the trap,” explained Dick.</p>

<p>“That’s well explained; now tell me something
else and I will keep quiet for a while,” said Garry.
“Why have you tied some extra threads to your
main line that leads to the lever?”</p>

<p>“That’s an extra precaution. If I had a wide
board that I could set in the ground, a weight on
any portion of it would cause the entire board to
sink a bit, and that would give the necessary pull
to release the lever. But we have no board and so
I must lay these strips of sapling close together.
Suppose that the intruder steps on one spot, he
would only cover about nine or ten of these saplings,
and if my string was not hitched to those
particular saplings, the trap wouldn’t work. The
idea of the extra strings is so that on whatever portion
of saplings anyone stands, he will be sure to
pull down on a string. Savvy?”</p>

<p>“Right, as usual, I stand corrected,” murmured
Garry in a purposely humble tone.</p>

<p>Dick looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to rag me a bit?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, not trying to,” answered Garry with special
emphasis on the word “trying.”</p>

<p>Dick was about to make a retort, then kept silent,
for he knew that Garry was having a bit of fun
with him, and in a battle of words with the sharp-witted
leader, he knew from experience that he
would come off second best.</p>

<p>All that remained now to do was to set the saplings.
Dick filled in the trench so that the saplings
would clear the ground by just about half an inch,
all that was necessary to bring down the little lever.
One by one the saplings were laid and the threads
attached, Dick drawing the string taut while Garry
held the lever up so that it would not be accidentally
pulled down. Finally the saplings were all laid.</p>

<p>“Now we must cover the saplings with some dirt
very carefully and smooth it down hard,” said Dick.
The dirt was sprinkled on and then bidding Garry
guard the lever, Dick patted it down hard on the
improvised platform.</p>

<p>“That’s good so far,” said Phil. “But won’t the
person who steps on that feel the give of it, and
become suspicious?”</p>

<p>“That’s one chance we will have to take, but I
intend to sprinkle a few pine needles on top of this
and try to give it the appearance of soft ground.
You know how often one steps on a springing,
spongy surface in the woods.” As he talked he
threw handfuls of pine needles on the spot.</p>

<p>“There, guess that’s camouflage for you. I don t
think anyone would ever know it had been fooled
with,” said Dick, with some pride in his handiwork.
And indeed he had good cause to be pleased, for
the ground looked not a whit different than the surroundings.</p>

<p>“There is just one thing more. That is the liability
of the intruder sneaking around the corner of
the lean-to and dodging the trap altogether,” said
Dick, “and we can soon fix that with a few saplings.
We will make a sort of little fence with an opening
only wide enough for an entrance. That will
serve a double purpose. It will make the intruder
step on the trap, and it will offset the appearance
of the brush wall at the back by making it appear
that we have simply fixed up our lean-to in fancy
fashion.” As he spoke, Dick began to make the
“fence,” and the others, catching onto the idea, lent
a willing hand.</p>

<p>When it was completed, the shack had a
comfortable air about it that led the boys to decide that
when the trap had served its purpose, the other
trappings would be left as they were.</p>

<p>“Now let’s pull out for town and see Denton and
look up Simmons, just to see what he has to say
for himself,” suggested Dick.</p>

<p>The chums slung their packs over their shoulders,
for they seldom went anywhere without them, not
knowing at what moment they might be called on
to make a hurried move.</p>

<p>The work of making the trap had required about
two hours, and the walk to town generally took
them an hour. This morning it was a trifle longer,
for the day was fine, and there was no especial need
of haste, hence they sauntered along at an easy pace,
while chattering about half a dozen different topics.</p>

<p>They reached town about ten in the morning
and proceeded to the general store. Denton was
sitting on the front porch, his usual place when the
duties of the store did not demand his attention.</p>

<p>He saw the boys approaching and waved to them
as they walked up the street.</p>

<p>“Well, what news this morning?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>“Nothing much more than usual. Simmons was
in this morning and looked around and asked when
the next batch of registered letters was expected,
and then said he was going to drive to Coldenham,
and off he went.”</p>

<p>“Why should he ask you when registered letters
would come?” asked Garry, who was rather puzzled
at what seemed the peculiarity of the question.</p>

<p>“How are you supposed to know anything about
when certain letters will arrive?”</p>

<p>“Lately, Ferguson’s office has been calling me on
the telephone to let me know when money was expected,
in the hope that I could exercise special care
for the safety of the letters. Of course I told Simmons
about it, so it was natural that he should ask
me about this.”</p>

<p>“Are any letters due today or tomorrow?” asked
Garry.</p>

<p>“Yes, I got notice early this morning that some
were expected from Portland in payment of the last
loads of pulp sent down the line.”</p>

<p>There was nothing else in the way of news, and
so the boys, after chatting about other matters for
a few moments, took up their way towards Aunt
Abbie’s house. On their way they passed the
French restaurant where Dick had once been imprisoned
by LeBlanc and Green, and were not
greatly surprised to see Lafe Green standing in the
doorway. He gave the boys a malevolent look as
they neared him, and when they passed by whispered
sibilantly:</p>

<p>“This is your last warning; get out of here and
get out quick!”</p>

<p>Garry stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>“Listen, Green. Let me give you a little warning.
You can’t drive us out of town with threats,
and all your little schemes and those of LeBlanc
won’t do you a bit of good. And there won’t be
any kidnapping either, for we are making no move
without letting someone know where we are going
and why. The moment that anyone of us disappears
for more than six hours, you and all your
friends will be tracked down and arrested.</p>

<p>“I am writing a complete account of this business
for the sheriff, and for the state authorities at
Augusta, so that any move you make will bring you
speedily before someone that you cannot get away
from. Now, is that clear to you?”</p>

<p>Green laughed loudly, but there was a false ring
in his mirth. The idea of the boys having a constant
check kept on their movements was not evidently
to his liking, neither was the fact that the
state authorities would take up the matter. He
knew, of course, that the boys were in the Ranger
Service—LeBlanc had told him that—and knew
that the Rangers would leave no stone unturned to
run down anyone that would harm a member of
that service.</p>

<p>“You make big talk, young fellow, but I’m telling
you that this country is dangerous for you;
not from me, understand, but from some people
that I don’t control. Better save your skins and
get back to the city and not concern yourselves with
things that you shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Green turned on his heel and walked into the restaurant,
and the boys resumed their way.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about a letter, Garry?” asked
Dick. “That is the first I’ve heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Garry. “It just struck me at
the moment, however, that it would be a wise thing
to do, and so I threw it at Lafe in the hopes that
it might check his future actions slightly. I believe
the shot went home at that.”</p>

<p>Arrived at Aunt Abbie’s, they found her all
wrought up.</p>

<p>Her first words exploded like a bombshell.</p>

<p>“Ruth went out last night and hasn’t been home
since!”</p>

<h2 id='chVI'
  class='chapter' title='VI. GARRY’S CHASE'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VI</span><br/>
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>GARRY’S CHASE</span>
</h2>

<p>“Ruth gone?” ejaculated Garry. “Are you sure
she has disappeared, or is there some place she
would have gone to visit?”</p>

<p>“Why, she would never have gone out for any
length of time without letting someone know where
she was going. She dressed for a walk a little
while after supper last night, and said she might
drop in and see her girl friend, Nellie Crombie.
When it came almost eleven o’clock her grandfather
got worried and went to Nellie’s house, where they
told him Ruth had left almost a half an hour before.
It wouldn’t take her more than ten minutes to get
home, so her grandfather got still more worried and
came straight back here. At midnight she hadn’t
come, and so he started out looking for her. He
went to all her friends, but no one had seen her.
Then he called up several people who live around
the Crombie’s place to see if they had seen her, but
no one had. He’s been up all night and was out
this morning looking around. He is nearly frantic
and so am I. I don’t know where she could have
gone.”</p>

<p>Aunt Abbie was all of a tremble as she told the
boys of the missing girl.</p>

<p>To the boys, here was something that demanded
immediate attention. They surmised at once that it
was part of the plan of the letter writers to terrorize
the family. First there was the burning house, and
since this had not succeeded in showing the little
family that the conspirators were in deadly earnest,
this last had been resorted to.</p>

<p>“Where can we find Mr. Everett now?” Garry
asked Aunt Abbie.</p>

<p>“Goodness only knows; he’s been everywhere,
asking all his friends if they have seen the girl.
Best thing to do would be to go back to the village
and ask if he has been seen. You ought to find him
real easy that way. There has been some talk of
organizing a search party to go into the woods,
but what would Ruth have wanted in the forest
alone and at night?”</p>

<p>The boys could not answer this question, and
were about to turn back to the village, when they
saw Mr. Everett approaching the house. He shuffled
along as though he were extremely weary.
When he saw the boys, his tired face lighted up.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you are here, for maybe you can help
me; no one else can around here. I suppose Aunt
Abbie has told you what has happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and we’re just on the point of starting
out to see what we can do,” said Garry. “Have you
any news at all?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I found a man that said he saw Ruth
going up Clemson street about twenty minutes to
eleven.”</p>

<p>“Where is Clemson street and where does it lead
to?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s on the other side of the village. You
boys know where it is; it’s the one you took that
night you went to Lafe Green’s farm; it leads right
past there and along towards the border.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a staggering thought hit Garry. Clemson
street leading to Lafe Green’s farm. The
secret passage. Ruth’s desire to help the boys play
detective. Her eagerness last night. The secret
that she would not let the boys in on.</p>

<p>All these thoughts flashed through Garry’s mind
in rapid succession.</p>

<p>“I believe I have a good clue, and we’ll follow it
up right away. My advice to you now, sir, is that
you hustle off to bed and get some sleep. You’ll
need all your strength, and you can depend on us
to do everything in our power to help you,” said the
Ranger leader.</p>

<p>“I guess I will take your advice. I’m tuckered
out, and I don’t believe I could go another step
without dropping. Now that I know you fellows
are here, it relieves my mind considerable. I’ll only
take a short nap and then wait for you to come back
with news,” said the old man as he turned into the
house.</p>

<p>Aunt Abbie was about to follow him, when Garry
caught her by the hand.</p>

<p>“Listen, Aunt Abbie. Don’t wake him up under
any circumstances, or we will have a mighty sick
man on our hands. Let him sleep as long as he can,
and in the meantime we’ll find something to work
on. Now you’ll do that, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, of course I will. He hasn’t
had a mite of sleep since yesterday morning. Now
good luck, boys, and bring our little girl back to
us,” said the kindly old lady.</p>

<p>Off down the street started Garry, followed by
his curious chums.</p>

<p>“What’s the big idea?” asked Dick. “Tell us
before we explode with curiosity. What is your
hunch?”</p>

<p>“Yes, out with it,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“I’m going to in a minute. I just wanted to get
away from the house so that Aunt Abbie or the old
gentleman would not hear us and worry. Here’s
my hunch. You know how Ruth has said a half a
dozen times that she envied us for our adventures,
and that a girl never could do anything, and how
she would like to help us out in this business?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we understand that; go on,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“And you know how excited she was yesterday
afternoon? Well, I think she went to Lafe Green’s
house to see if she could find anything out that
would be of help to us. You know she’s daring and
not afraid of anything, like so many girls are. It’s
ten to one that she went there. You remember she
knows about the secret passage because she was
there when her grandfather told us about it that
night.”</p>

<p>“Say, I believe you’re right, Garry. What’s the
next move then?” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as though the next move were to
go directly to Green’s house and have a showdown,”
said Phil.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Phil. On the march now. We’ll
keep this under our hat so that there will be no
danger of Lafe Green and his gang getting a tip.”</p>

<p>Almost running, they reached Clemson Road and
headed in the direction of Green’s farm.</p>

<p>On the way they discussed the most advisable
way to approach the house. Should there be any
force of men there, it would be folly to approach
the house openly, as it would give warning.</p>

<p>As they neared the place, Garry called a halt to
allow them to regain their breath, for they were all
puffing so fast had Garry set the pace. Also, he
wanted to hold a council.</p>

<p>“There, we can see the house from here,” he said
as they gathered under a big tree. “I thought I
remembered the general lay of the land. You see
we can go around through the field there and come
up back of the barn, and from there to the house is
so short a distance that we can make it in a few
seconds on the run. Dick, you get in front of the
barn after we reach the house, to prevent anyone
from making an escape through the secret passage.
Phil and I will beard the lion in his den.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute, though,” put in Dick. “I am
game to do anything you decide, but can we go
busting into a man’s house without a warrant or
any authority?”</p>

<p>“Technically we can’t, but this seems to be a time
for action if ever there was one. If we find our
guess to be correct, and Ruth is held there, no one
will bring up the question of our authority. We are
dealing with known criminals, and we can show
good cause for our suspicions. At any rate, we’ll
think about that later. Like the western sheriffs
used to say, it’s a case of shoot first and ask questions
afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” said Garry enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Garry’s enthusiasm was transferred to the others,
and off across the fields they started, bending low
in the hay to avoid detection as much as possible,
although they did not think too sharp a watch was
being kept in the day time, except possibly the roadway
that led to the house.</p>

<p>When they reached the back of the barn, Garry
halted them again.</p>

<p>“First look to your rifles. We might need them.
Now, Dick, give us forty seconds to reach the
house, then run around and take your stand where
you can watch the barn door. If you need help, fire
your rifle twice. Now Phil, shoot for the house.”</p>

<p>Garry and Phil started and Dick glued his eyes
on his watch.</p>

<p>At the house they saw no sign of anyone having
heard their approach, and there seemed to be no
indication of anyone’s being around. Garry began
to think the house was deserted and made up his
mind that even if this were the case he was going
through it.</p>

<p>They came around to the front door, which stood
open, and Garry stuck his head through the doorway
and called:</p>

<p>“Hullo, there in the house.”</p>

<p>Both boys kept their rifles in such position that
they could be thrown up instantly. For a moment
there was no response, then Garry repeated his call.
There was a sound of someone shuffling along in his
stocking feet, then a man came into the hall.</p>

<p>Garry and Phil almost dropped their rifles from
surprise, for there stood one of the tramps.</p>

<p>“What you want,” he half grunted. From his
tousled appearance he had evidently been asleep.</p>

<p>“We want to have a look through this house, and
while we’re at it we want you,” answered Garry.</p>

<p>“Want me?” asked the man, surprised out of his
drowsiness.</p>

<p>“Yes; you’re wanted for bail jumping down
Portland way. The Gordon station and postoffice
robbery, you know.”</p>

<p>“You policemen?” asked the man, who appeared
dazed at the knowledge of the boys concerning him.</p>

<p>“No, we’re not policemen, but we’re going to take
a look through this house and then take you back
to the village,” said Garry firmly.</p>

<p>“Where’s your warrant?” demanded the tramp.</p>

<p>“Haven’t got one,” returned Garry promptly.</p>

<p>“Then you can’t do anything with me,” announced
the man, becoming bolder.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes we can. We’re officers of the state, and
besides, any citizen can apprehend a criminal and
turn him over to an officer. Now speak up lively
and tell us if there is a girl being held prisoner in
this house.”</p>

<p>A momentary gleam of fear appeared in the
man’s eyes, but he made haste to answer:</p>

<p>“’Course not; ain’t no womenkind of any sort
around here. This is Mr. Green’s house.”</p>

<p>Both Garry and Phil could see the man was lying,
and knew that their guess was correct. Either
Ruth was in the house, or this tramp knew something
about her.</p>

<p>“Come on now, come through. You know the
girl I mean. Where is she? Phil, keep your rifle
on this fellow, and if he makes a move while I go
through the house, blow him up,” ordered Garry.</p>

<p>“Say, listen. What do I get if I put you fellows
wise to all this?” demanded the tramp. “And how
do you chaps know anything about me? Not that
I’m admittin’ anything you said about me.”</p>

<p>“We know you all right. We helped catch you
in our cottage down Portland way early this summer,”
said Garry.</p>

<p>The tramp peered at Garry closely. Then he
spat out an oath.</p>

<p>“I thought I knew you when I saw you the other
day. Guess you’ve got me right. Well, you
haven’t told me what I get if I tell you about the
girl.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get nothing in the way of being let loose,
if that’s what you’re driving at,” answered Garry.
“And if you don’t tell us what you know you will
come in for a few years extra on a charge of abduction.
I’ll do this though. You tell us what you
know and we’ll put it in on our report and that will
get you out of this scrape.”</p>

<p>The tramp thought this over for a moment, and
then appeared to decide that the jig was up and he
might as well save himself at the expense of his
pals.</p>

<p>“There was a girl came here last night through
a certain passage to the house here, and Green and
the Frenchman discovered her listening to them talk
and caught her before she could get away.”</p>

<p>“What Frenchman do you mean?” interposed
Garry quickly.</p>

<p>“The one they call Jean,” answered the tramp
sullenly.</p>

<p>So there was another hunch that made good.
Green and Jean had hitched forces again. That
meant that the halfbreed had come directly to this
place after he had made his escape from the lumber-camp
with the aid of the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Where is she now, in the house here?” demanded
Garry eagerly.</p>

<p>“No,” said the man. “They was afraid someone
was with her or was going to follow her here, so
they rushed her out. That is, the Frenchman did.
He said he would take her to a hideout he had. I
think he said it was on the river; what did he call
it? Penicton, or something like that.”</p>

<p>“I know. Penocton is the name, Garry. That’s
the one we visited that time we found our tourmaline
mine,” put in Phil.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything more about it than
that?” quizzed Garry.</p>

<p>“No, that’s all I know.”</p>

<p>“Just one thing more,” said Garry hurriedly.
“How did you fellows come to be hitched up with
this gang?”</p>

<p>“Green hired us to do a little job for him.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“None of your business. Say, look here. I’ve
told you all you wanted to know, more than I
should. Now my mouth’s shut, see? I ain’t a goin’
to tell you nothin’ more. Not even if you beat my
head in with your gun,” and the tramp relapsed into
sullen silence. He seemed to be sorry now that he
had gone so far in his answers.</p>

<p>“Phil, there’s one chance that all this may be a
string of lies; and to be on the safe side, I’m going
through the house. You keep this fellow under
cover, and if anyone approaches, fire your rifle once,
and back this fellow into the house, and make him
lock the door. I’ll be with you, then, in a minute.”</p>

<p>Garry went into the house and made a systematic
search of the house, starting with the top floor and
the attic, peering into all the closets and any spot
that would make a likely hiding place. He made
no discoveries on the top floor, and descended to the
main floor again. Here he found nothing, and was
preparing to descend the cellar for a last look, when
he saw the latch on the door being raised.</p>

<p>He stood stock still, and lifting his rifle, waited
in silence.</p>

<p>The door opened slowly and noiselessly, and he
was just about to order whoever was behind it to
come out, as he was covered, when a head came cautiously
around the door, and Garry dropped his
rifle butt to the floor and began to laugh.</p>

<p>Instead of Green or one of his cohorts, as he had
expected, the head belonged to no other than Dick!</p>

<p>“Say, I’m glad to see you” said Dick with a sigh
of relief. “We did a fool thing in not deciding how
long I was to wait without hearing from you; and
you were so long that I thought you had been
found and were tied up in some corner with Green
and all his friends standing guard over you. So I
came through the passageway to see if I could be
of any help. What’s new? Have you found
Ruth?”</p>

<p>In a few brief sentences Garry informed him of
what had transpired in the past few minutes.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll get our prize tramp here and hustle
him back to town and deliver him over to the constable.
Then, while you fellows follow our original
plan about the engineer, I’ll set out after Ruth.
It’ll have to be luck for me to find her, but I’ll track
down the river bank in the hope of finding some
trail.”</p>

<p>The return to town was made without incident,
though the boys kept a sharp watch for fear that
some of the tramp’s friends might come along and
attempt to free him from his captivity. They led
him directly to the little lock-up and turned him
over to the constable with instructions to notify the
sheriff so he could get in touch with the authorities
at Portland.</p>

<p>Garry’s last words to the tramp were to bid him
to keep silent about his having told them about
Ruth and LeBlanc, threatening if he opened his
mouth to forget his promise to plead for special
immunity for him. The tramp readily agreed to
keep his silence.</p>

<p>“Now gather round here fellows. I’m going to
stock up on provisions, and start for the river. You
fellows had better arrange between yourselves to
keep an eye on the engineer and Green. Decide who
will take the engineer, and the other one watch
Lafe. Either one may lead you to a clue.</p>

<p>“So that we will have check on my movements,
start about eleven o’clock tomorrow morning to call
me on the wireless. Keep calling me at intervals
for two hours. Set your range for about twenty-five
miles. I won’t be further away than that. If
you cannot get me, get the sheriff and have Green
taken up again and squeezed until he comes through
with information about the girl. Of course LeBlanc
will be arrested on sight, if he comes back here, but
he probably is wherever he has taken Ruth.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we don’t hear from you; what about
your own safety?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“In that case, get some help and come after me.
My plan is to go to that little town we passed
through the time we found the tourmaline mine,
and then head across the river. You remember it
was all wooded land on the other side. I’ll leave
several trail signs to show whether I went up or
down the river. Then at intervals of a half a mile,
I’ll tie a strip of white cloth to a bough on one of
the trees along the river bank. If I turn into the
woods at any point, I’ll tie the strip there and then
leave trail signs. Keep an eye out for a small stone
cairn, for I may leave a note. Now I’m off to the
store for some groceries.”</p>

<p>Giving each of his chums a hearty grip of the
hand, Garry headed for Denton’s general store.</p>

<p>Denton asked him several questions about why
he was purchasing extra provisions, but Garry gave
him evasive answers.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Garry, “how come you didn’t
think to tell us this morning about Miss Ruth
Everett being missing?”</p>

<p>“I swan, I forgot all about it. I haven’t been
thinking about much of anything lately except that
dratted postoffice business. Then when I did think
of it, you were out of sight. Have they heard anything
about the girl?”</p>

<p>“Guess they’re working on something now.”
Garry refrained from answering any questions, for
there were three or four other men in the store, and
he was now proceeding on the idea that every man
was a potential enemy until he was proven otherwise.</p>

<p>Garry packed his knapsack carefully, and as a
last thought bought a couple of yards of white cloth
with which to make the trail marks he had promised
to leave.</p>

<p>He took the trail they had taken the day they set
out to discover the mine after they had succeeded
in getting the missing portion of the torn map.</p>

<p>It was a good twenty mile hike to the town, and
Garry put his best foot forward, for he wanted to
reach the town before dark. He decided he would
put up there for the night in the village hotel, if
there was one, rather than stay in the woods.</p>

<p>Garry did not think it wise to sleep out in the
forest where some misfortune might befall him, at
a time when he needed all his strength, and above
all, his liberty. Then, too, he wanted a good night’s
sleep to be fresh for the coming day, which he
fancied would be a hard one.</p>

<p>As he walked, he kept a keen lookout for any
signs of trail,—a dropped handkerchief, or something
of the sort. Garry hoped that Ruth would
find some way of dropping something that might
serve as a clue, for she was a bright girl, and knew
that any little help would aid those whom she knew
would seek to trail her as soon as her absence was
discovered.</p>

<p>His pains were unrewarded, however, as he
walked mile after mile. Garry was straining every
nerve to make time, and took a pace that was much
faster than the boys generally used when on plain
patrol duty. Their summer in the woods had made
good walkers of all of them, and they were able to
make decent distances without more than ordinary
fatigue.</p>

<p>It had been noon time when Garry left Hobart,
and allowing himself until seven o’clock to get to
the village of Chester, it would mean that he must
make a trifle less than four miles every hour, counting
out a few minutes for a breathing spell after
every fifty or fifty-five minutes of walking.</p>

<p>His reckoning was not far wrong, for it was only
about a quarter after seven when he pulled into
Chester. He asked a pedestrian if there was any
sort of a hotel or boarding house in the village, and
was directed to one a short ways down the street.
Garry was ravenously hungry, so he had his supper
at the hotel, getting in just before the dining room
closed. It was a typical country hotel, and the fare
was good. After he had eaten, he sought out the
owner and engaged him in conversation.</p>

<p>Garry asked what the other side of the river was
like and if the woodland extended for many miles
in both directions.</p>

<p>“On the upper side is the State Forest reserve,
well patrolled by Rangers, while to the south is
wild land that has not been cut for years,” said the
hotel man.</p>

<p>“There was some talk of cutting there last winter,
and then they decided to hold up till a track
could be laid and the logs hauled to the river on
flat cars to save time. In that way they could begin
cutting at the far side and work toward the river.
A party of surveyors laid out the proposed track,
and they even laid about a half a mile of track.
Then the owner died—name was Hasbrouck, I
think—and his estate got tied up in the courts, and
the work on the road was stopped. Now there’s no
one around there. Once in a great while a camping
party goes in there, but it isn’t popular except during
the deer season, because of its wild growth, lots
of ravines and rocky places.”</p>

<p>This long explanation was given Garry by the
hotel owner, and Garry mentally decided that if
LeBlanc had come there—and this was likely if the
tramp’s words were true—this would be the section
he would go to. The halfbreed would probably
keep away from the Forest Reserve, with the chance
of running across a Ranger.</p>

<p>Asking if the general store was open, and receiving
an affirmative reply, Garry got directions for
reaching it and set out. He knew that in all New
England villages, the general store is the hangout
for most of the men after nightfall, and here was
the best place to get any likely gossip.</p>

<p>Garry found a half dozen men gathered inside,
watching a checker game between two old men who
were evidently the crack players of the village.</p>

<p>He made two or three minor purchases, mostly
to get into conversation with the storekeeper.</p>

<p>The owner himself was there, and after he had
sized up Garry’s attire, asked in true Yankee
fashion:</p>

<p>“Come from the city?”</p>

<p>“Some little time ago,” answered Garry, “if you
can call living only a few miles from Portland
being from the city.”</p>

<p>“Figure on going campin’ around here?”</p>

<p>“No, just hiking through for awhile.”</p>

<p>“Fellow in here this morning and bought a lot of
stuff, enough to last a while, so thought that you
might be following him up, since he was alone, and
camping alone ain’t much fun.”</p>

<p>Garry was not particularly interested in campers,
but he wanted to ask some questions later, and
knowing the Yankee way, which was to talk of
other things and get acquainted by asking questions
first, asked carelessly if the storekeeper knew the
other man, or heard where he was going.</p>

<p>“No, never saw him before, and he warn’t the
kind to give out much information about himself.
After I talk with a man a few minutes, I generally
get to the point where I can swap questions with
him; but this chap looked as though he didn’t want
a friend in the world, and maybe didn’t have one.”</p>

<p>“Grouchy looking customer, eh?” said Garry with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, siree Bob, not only grouchy looking, but
hard looking. Now that I think of him, I see it
was foolish to ask if you were with him, for he was
a different breed of cats from you. Funny looking
bird.”</p>

<p>“What did he look like,” asked Garry, mainly to
keep conversation up for a few minutes longer.</p>

<p>“Big black-haired chap with a black moustache
and dark skin, high cheek bones, looked like a halfbreed
to me. Talked pretty good English, but with
a little accent like they do up by the border.”</p>

<p>Garry’s heart beat high with excitement, for the
storekeeper had described Jean LeBlanc to a “T.”</p>

<p>When Garry left them, Phil and Dick debated
as to what course they would pursue. Phil advanced
the suggestion that one should make shift to
get on the train that went to Coldenham and see
what, if anything, transpired along the way.</p>

<p>“First I move we go to see Denton and find out
if there will be any valuable mail sent this afternoon,”
said Phil.</p>

<p>This was met with assent by Dick, and they departed
for the general store.</p>

<p>“Your friend was here only a little while ago,”
Denton told them. “Bought a lot of stuff and then
hiked off. Goin’ to follow him?”</p>

<p>“No; he’s gone off on a little private trip,” said
Phil. He gave no more information, since he saw
plainly that Garry had told the postmaster very little
about what he intended to do.</p>

<p>When they asked about the mail, Denton said:</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s quite a batch of it for the Ferguson
outfit came in on the noon train, and there are
several letters with cash in them from around this section.
He owns a lot of property round here, and
this is about time for the rents to be sent to him.
Getting near the first of the month, and he’s a hard
landlord, especially to the tenant farmers. Raises
hob with them if they’re a day behind on the rent,
and to be on the safe side, most of them send it
before the first.”</p>

<p>Dick glanced at Phil, as though to say that this
was the proper day to start investigating.</p>

<p>Phil asked Denton if he would mind his looking
at the letters.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t a regular thing to do, but guess it will
be all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that I want to inspect the letters.
I only want to see the way they are carried. I
wouldn’t ask to touch United States mail without
proper authority,” explained Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” and Denton led the way to
the office, where he opened the safe and showed
them a heavy leather sack.</p>

<p>“I lock it here and keep the key, and the postmaster
at Coldenham has a key to open it with.
Often times there’s registered mail only for the Ferguson
mill, and that’s the case today,” said the postmaster,
as he locked the safe.</p>

<p>“How is that taken to the train?” questioned
Dick.</p>

<p>“I generally take it myself, or else send Bill, my
assistant in the store, with it. We give it to the
engineer, Gardener his name is, and he gives us a
receipt. We have regular blanks for it. Then it’s
met by the postoffice man at the other end.”</p>

<p>“What does the crew of that train consist of,”
was Dick’s next question.</p>

<p>At this query Denton began to laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, now let’s see. There’s the engineer and
the fireman and the conductor and the brakeman
and the railway mail clerk. And the name of all of
him is Gardner.”</p>

<p>“You mean it’s a one-man train?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Don’t need any more than that. There
isn’t any stop between here and Coldenham, and the
only provision for passengers is about half a coach;
the rest of the car is used for baggage, whenever
there is any. Then the rest of the train is made
up of freight cars that are used for pulp. The station
agent here takes the tickets as the people get on
the train, and the engineer only has to run the train.
He fires himself most of the time. In bad weather
he has a helper. It’s only a one-way track and few
crossings, so he’s really all that’s needed. Old Ferguson
is a tight Scotchman and won’t pay out any
more than he can help in spite of the fact he’s the
wealthiest man around here.”</p>

<p>Having gotten their desired information, they
left the store and held a conclave.</p>

<p>“See how this strikes you, Dick. I’ll find some
way to get on that freight train without being observed,
and after we get started I’ll get near the
engine and watch if the engineer throws any letters
out to anyone, or makes a stop to let some confederate
on.</p>

<p>“In the meantime you keep watch on Lafe Green,
and perhaps you could go to the lean-to and see if
your camera trap worked. I suggest that I go on
the train, because it would be easier for me to board
it while it was going, as I may possibly have to do,
and since I am a little lighter than you, no offense,
Dick, I could manage better on a moving train.”</p>

<p>“That gives you all the fun,” half grumbled Dick,
“But I see your point, and this is a case of getting
results and not having adventure. Besides, I want
to see if that trap worked, and if we can find out the
perpetrator of the rattle snake trick.”</p>

<p>This being settled, the boys separated. Dick
thought for a moment of going straight to the
French restaurant and getting something to eat, and
sizing up the inmates, also to see who Lafe might
be talking with.</p>

<p>However, he discarded this thought as being foolhardy,
and wisely decided there was no need of
putting his mouth in the lion’s jaws needlessly. He
remembered the time he was captured by this outfit
before, and had no desire for a second experience.</p>

<p>Furthermore, his appearance there would immediately
put anyone he wanted to watch on guard,
and he could accomplish nothing. It was well past
noon, and Dick, as usual, remembering his inner
man, decided to go to Aunt Abbie’s and prevail on
her to give him something to eat, and at the same
time see how Mr. Everett was. There was always
the slim chance that Ruth might have turned up,
but this was only a chance in a thousand.</p>

<p>For his part, Phil went towards the station to
reconnoitre the ground and see what would be his
chances of boarding the train that went to Coldenham.</p>

<p>He looked carefully around the station platform
to see if there was anyone he knew, or anyone who
would be apt to be interested in his movements, but
outside of one or two loafers, the platform and station
were devoid of people. The station agent was
in his little office busily ticking away at the telegraph
key, sending a message.</p>

<p>After his hasty survey, Phil darted on into the
yards. Although Hobart was a very small town,
the yards there were quite sizable, since it was a
sort of a transfer point for freight and passengers
bound into Canada, and then there was a long
siding that was used for the pulp cars that came from
Ferguson’s mills at Coldenham.</p>

<p>Along one side of the siding was the long storehouse
where the bulky packages of pulp were stored
until a sufficient quantity had accumulated to make
it worth while to have a long string of freight cars
come from Bangor or below to carry it to the paper
mills.</p>

<p>Phil noted that the Coldenham train was already
on this siding, but the engineer was nowhere to be
seen. He made his way to the storehouse landing
and walked along the string of cars wondering in
just what manner he could get on the train without
being observed. He did not, of course, care to buy
a ticket and ride as a regular passenger, for that
would tip his hand to any of the enemy that might
be around.</p>

<p>There was the chance of ducking into one of the
freight cars, and hiding there until the train started,
and then in some manner making his way to the
roof of the car, and in this way proceed along the
top until he could come within sight of the cab.</p>

<p>The slight element of danger in this was that
some station employe or the engineer himself, for
that matter, might make a tour of the cars just for
the purpose of preventing anyone from getting a
free ride.</p>

<p>After conning over the situation, Phil discarded
the idea of boarding the train while it was in the
yard.</p>

<p>There was still a long wait until the train would
start, so Phil decided to utilize it by strolling up the
track for a short distance to see if there was any
spot where he could wait and, unobserved, get on
the moving train. He walked nearly a mile, but
saw that there was no spot where he could do this.
In some places, a house or two bordered the tracks,
and women could be seen working in little gardens,
or sewing while sitting in front of the houses.</p>

<p>At others, where there was no danger of being
seen, the ditching at the side of the road provided
no place where he could locate himself without
being observed by the engineer.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch and saw that he still had
plenty of time for further investigation, so he
walked on.</p>

<p>His added walk was rewarded, for he came to a
spot where there was a fairly deep cut between two
natural miniature cliffs. Spanning the cliffs was an
open bridge; that is, it was open at the top, but the
sides came up for a matter of three feet or so.</p>

<p>This was just what he wanted. He could wait
until he heard the approach of the train and then
hide behind one of the sides of the bridge. As
soon as the engine had passed under, he would only
have to crawl over the side, and drop to the top of
one of the cars as it passed under the bridge. Looking up,
Phil estimated that there was only about two
feet clearance between the top of a car and the bottom
of the bridge.</p>

<p>This would make it a safe proposition to drop to
the train, even though it was moving. Had it been
anything but the slow Coldenham train, he knew
such a feat would be impossible, for a swiftly moving
express would have thrown him off almost as
soon as he touched the top.</p>

<p>There was little to do now but wait until the
train should approach. Phil wondered if the road
was in constant use, for should a team or an automobile
be passing as he attempted to board the train,
his work would be for nothing.</p>

<p>This, however, was one chance that he would
have to take.</p>

<p>It was a warm, drowsy afternoon, and but one
team passed him as he sat on the wall that protected
the bridge. He whiled away the time by
finding a stick of soft wood, which he whittled into
odd shapes, for Phil was a wizard with his penknife,
and a friend to all the children in his home
town, as they were constantly importuning him to
carve dolls for them or whittle a ball inside of a
little cage. Phil, who loved the work for an idle
moment, seldom refused them.</p>

<p>At last he heard the sound of the train
approaching, and quickly dropped to cover behind the wall.
The train came along at a fair rate of speed, wheezing
and puffing at every revolution of the wheels.</p>

<p>Phil’s heart beat rapidly, for this was the crucial
moment. If a team or auto should happen to pass
just as he was in the act of dropping to the train,
there was no knowing what might happen, and he
did not want anyone to have the knowledge that
he had gone on this mission.</p>

<p>He strained his ears to catch the sound of the
approach of any vehicle, but the noise of the oncoming
train drowned out all other sounds.</p>

<p>Phil heard the engine pass under the bridge, and
then hastily clambered up over the wall, and giving
a quick look in either direction, and fortunately
seeing nothing, lowered himself and dropped to the
roof of a car about midway in the string. He hit
the roof with a thud that almost knocked the breath
from him as his feet hit the top.</p>

<p>However, he retained his presence of mind, and
dropped quickly to his hands and knees and grasped
the running board that is on the top of all freight
cars. The momentum of the moving train was
greater than he thought it would be, and he was
afraid for a moment that he was going to be
thrown off after all.</p>

<p>But fortune favored him, and he kept his grip,
although he scratched his hands severely in so
doing.</p>

<p>The train chugged on its way, and Phil was content
to lie on the top of the car for awhile and get
a breathing spell. He had been told that after the
train was about five miles out of the town, it passed
a long strip of woodland that reached almost to
Coldenham. Phil thought it wiser not to attempt
to get near the engine until they had reached these
woods, and also he knew that lying there on the
top of the car, he might attract some attention from
a chance passerby.</p>

<p>With this thought in mind, he began to edge
along toward one end of the car. Reaching his
objective, he found the ladder and crawled down
between the two freight cars, and clinging to the
ladder, with his feet braced on the narrow ledge
over the coupling, maintained a safe but uncomfortable
position.</p>

<p>Suddenly the train began to slow down perceptibly,
and he wondered whether or not he had been
seen, and the engineer was coming back to investigate.</p>

<p>In that case there would be only one thing to do,
and that was cut and run, taking refuge among the
trees, for he had seen that the train had entered the
woodland.</p>

<p>Phil risked taking a look by peering out around
the car’s side, and what he saw surprised him
sharply, although he was prepared for anything that
might happen.</p>

<p>The train had come almost to a stop, and he saw
the engineer leap down from his steps on the cab
and stretch out a helping hand to someone that
darted at that moment out of the woods.</p>

<p>The person that the engineer helped aboard was
none other than Simmons, the postal inspector!</p>

<p>“Aha,” thought Phil to himself. “I am beginning
to think I am on a warm trail. Now to get
up towards the cab and see what this is all about.”</p>

<p>There was every chance that he would be seen
as he got near to the cab, but at that moment
Nature came to his aid. The sky darkened. Great
black clouds rolled across the dome of the world,
and it became almost as dark as dusk. It was one
of those sudden summer storms, and that, and the
fact that they were passing through the forest, made
it just a shade lighter than night.</p>

<p>This Phil thought was the appropriate time to
get close to the cab, and clambering back to the top
of the car made his precarious way along the tops
of the string. The pelting rain soaked him to the
skin, and in addition made the walking perilous, for
the boards became almost as slippery as glass.</p>

<p>When he came within two cars of the engine, he
dropped to his hands and knees, and crawled, animal
fashion, along the top. The rain and the darkness
still continued, and as he neared the end of the last
car, he laid flat and wriggled along until he came
to the edge.</p>

<p>From his perch he could see down into the cab
of the engine, across the small coal tender. He
could see the engineer and Simmons engaged in an
animated conversation, but the rush of the train and
the noise of the rain made it impossible to hear
what they were saying.</p>

<p>He could see perfectly, by the light from the
open engine boiler door, all that was transpiring,
and what he saw gave him the solution to the mystery
of the missing letters.</p>

<p>Simmons had taken a small tool of some sort
from his pocket and was engaged in picking the
lock of the registered mail bag.</p>

<p>He made short work of this, and then ensued a
strange scene.</p>

<p>The engineer worked a small pet-cock that let
out a thin stream of hot steam, and passing the
letters back and forth over this, Simmons opened
them. That is, he opened several that he had
selected, after a hasty glance at the superscription.</p>

<p>From the envelopes, he took out some of the
contents, and then moistening the glue again with
steam, carefully pressed them back. This process
is often used by culprits, but it speaks well for the
law that few of them get very far with it, for
Uncle Sam safeguards his mails with an eternal
vigilance.</p>

<p>To Phil it appeared that the postal inspector was
either an out and out criminal, who had successfully
blinded the postoffice department to his criminal
ways, or had for some reason succumbed to
temptation. Later he was to learn what the real
reason was.</p>

<p>Phil was wondering what his next step had better
be,—to go back and seek the safety of the space
between two cars and ride to Coldenham and there
get into connection with Ferguson and have the
pair arrested, or to try and drop off just before they
struck the town and get some conveyance to take
him back to Hobart, where he could confer with
Dick and possibly arrange to see how far Simmons
would go.</p>

<p>Then he thought that the best course would be
to get straight to Coldenham so that Ferguson
could have the guilty pair taken up and recover the
money and checks that had been taken from the
envelopes.</p>

<p>He had decided that this was the wisest course,
and was about to go back along the top of the car,
when the train suddenly swerved, as it rounded a
curve, and threw Phil, who was not expecting it,
from his perch.</p>

<p>Had it been dry, he could probably have kept his
grip; but the continued rain had made the top wet
and slippery, and try though he did to keep hold,
he was unsuccessful and slipped from the top.</p>

<p>As he fell, he remembered that he should relax
his muscles as much as possible, as acrobats do
when they fall while doing some tumbling trick.</p>

<p>He struck the ground and a sharp twinge of pain
ran through his leg. He could not keep his balance,
and fell back against the ground with a jarring
thud.</p>

<p>His head hit a stone, and he lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>DICK’S FOOTBALL TACKLE</span>
</h2>

<p>Left alone by Phil to pursue his own devices,
Dick carried out his intention of getting something
to eat before going any farther, and accordingly
turned his steps in the direction of Aunt Abbie’s
house.</p>

<p>He went around to the back door, and with his
hat in his hand, gave an imitation of what he imagined
would be a tramp asking for a “hand-out.”</p>

<p>He knocked at the door, and just as it was
opened, asked in a whining tone for something to
eat. The door was hardly opened, when he heard
Aunt Abbie’s brisk voice:</p>

<p>“Start right in on that woodpile first.”</p>

<p>At this Dick could not hold in, and he began to
laugh heartily.</p>

<p>The laugh evidently surprised Aunt Abbie, for
she threw the door wide open and peered out over
the tops of her glasses. When she recognized the
“tramp,” she too began to laugh, and said:</p>

<p>“Come in, you young scalawag. Just for what
you did I’ve a good notion to make you earn your
dinner anyway.”</p>

<p>“Glad to help out a bit even for nothing,”
promptly offered the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Well, seeing you’re so willing, we’ll let you off
this time. I dunno what I can give you to eat.
Fire’s gone down, and all I’ve got is some fresh
tomatoes and some salad dressing and cucumbers
and pie and doughnuts, and some cold milk out of
the ice box, and——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Aunt Abbie,” interrupted Dick.
“There’s only one person here. I haven’t got a half
a dozen people with me.”</p>

<p>“Why, what difference does that make?” inquired
the old lady, somewhat tartly.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve named over enough things to feed
a regiment with.”</p>

<p>“Good land, don’t you suppose I know just what
a growing boy can eat? Goodness knows I ought
to. I raised four sons myself, all of them in the
city and all doin’ well too.”</p>

<p>Dick sat down in the cool kitchen while Aunt
Abbie scurried about getting his lunch. She kept
up a running fire of chatter as she worked, it being
mostly about the missing Ruth. She wanted to
know what news any of the boys had, and what they
were doing to find her.</p>

<p>“Garry has some sort of a clue that he has a lot
of faith in, and has gone to look it up. You needn’t
worry, Aunt Abbie. If she’s to be found, Garry is
the boy to do the trick.”</p>

<p>Dick did not want to tell her that Ruth was in
the power of Jean LeBlanc, for he knew that she
would worry even more. Then he asked how the
grandfather was.</p>

<p>“Land sakes, he’s still asleep; just played out,
and it looks as though he will sleep till night anyway,
maybe more. I’ve kept everything quiet about
the house so as not to disturb him. There, now,
eat your lunch, it’s all ready. What are you going
to do this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I am keeping my eyes on Lafe Green for awhile,
and then I thought I’d go back to our place in the
woods and see what luck I had with a little experiment
that I’m trying out,” answered Dick as he
tackled the luscious food set before him.</p>

<p>“Well, you better get into the woods pretty soon
and get back again, for it’s going to rain great guns
before night. Not a storm that will last long, just
a good shower that will wet things down right and
set the gardens growing again.”</p>

<p>Dick looked out through the open window at the
cloudless sky, and asked in surprise:</p>

<p>“Why, the sky is as clear as crystal. What
makes you think it’s going to rain?”</p>

<p>“Lots o’ signs say it’s going to, but there’s one
that never fails,” answered the old lady. “My cat’s
been washing her face all morning and bringing
her paw over her right ear every time, and further
she’s been outdoors eating the tops off the grass for
the last hour.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed heartily at this as a weather sign,
until he saw that he was in danger of offending the
old lady. So he muffled his laughter and said:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Aunt Abbie, but that’s a new one
on me. I never before heard tell of a cat acting as
a barometer.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can depend on Thomas Jones, that’s
the name of my cat, to let me know whenever it’s
going to rain in the summer.”</p>

<p>Dick finished his luncheon and then took his departure,
promising to be back for supper unless
something tied him up and prevented him. It
should be mentioned that the boys had made arrangements
to board at Aunt Abbie’s whenever they
were in the town, so he was not exactly inviting
himself to be a guest that night.</p>

<p>“Well, go along, and bring good news back with
you when you come,” said the kindly Aunt Abbie
as she began to clear away the dishes.</p>

<p>Thoroughly satisfied with the world, the fat
youth sauntered towards the center of the village,
and reconnoitred about the restaurant kept by the
old Frenchman. No one was in sight, and he wandered
down the street.</p>

<p>As he neared the corner where stood the general
store, he saw Lafe Green disappearing around the
side of the store. He followed cautiously, and let
Green get a considerable start, and then trailed him.
It was an easy job, for Green took to the woods
that surrounded the town and walked swiftly.
Dick dodged from tree to tree, keeping well back,
but always close enough to make out Green’s form.</p>

<p>Lafe seemed to be circling as he walked, and
Dick wondered what the idea was. Then it
dawned on him, that from the direction he was taking,
Lafe was headed for his own home. Dick at
once concluded that there was some reason for his
wanting to approach his own place without being
detected. It was only a few moments before the
boy saw the reason for the roundabout course.</p>

<p>Lafe took a stand under one of the trees, and in
a few minutes was joined by two other men. Peering
from his vantage point in back of a great
spruce, Dick was startled to note that the new companions
of Green were the two tramps that still
remained at liberty.</p>

<p>They talked together in low tones for a moment,
and then moved away. Walking as though the
ground were covered with sharp needles and eggs
and seeking shelter behind a tree every few seconds,
Dick followed the trio.</p>

<p>As he thought, they headed for Lafe’s house,
coming in from the back. When he was sure of
their destination, Dick cut through the standing
hay, and wriggling along on the ground, in a
manner that the boys had read of the Indians doing,
and had often practiced as youngsters, he approached
the house. The hay field, as he knew,
ran almost to the house, and ended at a stone wall
not fifteen feet from the farmhouse. When he
arrived at the wall he saw that the two tramps
were sitting on the porch, while Lafe had gone inside
on some errand. What the errand consisted of,
was presently shown when the owner of the farm
came out with a jug of cider.</p>

<p>“Not a soul inside, not even poor Bill. How he
managed to let those cussed boys get him is more
than I can make out,” muttered Green to the
tramps. His words were quite distinguishable to
Dick, for a gentle breeze was blowing in his direction,
over which the voices of the men were carried
as though on a telephone wire.</p>

<p>“Well have a score to settle with those birds
aforelong,” growled one of the tramps. “But anyway,
Bill can’t be much good when he lets a bunch
of boys take him off. Can’t we get him bailed
out?”</p>

<p>“Don’t see how. I’m out on bail myself, and it
took nearly every penny I had to do that. Besides,
I ain’t any too well liked by the law and order
folks around here, and ’tisn’t likely they’d take my
bail for him. We’ll have to do those two jobs alone
tonight, and that will give us some money to work
with and we’ll see then what can be done.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of jobs, which will we take first, the
store or the bank?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Guess we better take the store first and get that
over with; then it’ll be pretty late and we can take
our time with the bank,” answered Green. “Say we
get to the store at midnight; everyone’ll be in bed
then. Look here, it’s getting hot outside, and it’s
cooler in the house. Bring that jug inside with
you,” and Lafe turned and went into the house, followed
by the others.</p>

<p>Light instantly broke over Dick. That was the
reason for the friendliness between the tramps and
Lafe Green. They were evidently plotting to break
and enter the store and the bank. Green knew nothing
of this branch of criminality, and had in some
way become acquainted with the tramps and had
gone partners with them in this nefarious expedition.</p>

<p>Dick wished that they had stayed out on the
porch and further discussed their plans. He knew
it would be foolhardy to try and approach the house
with the three of them there, for one might be at a
window and they could easily seize him. He had
not brought his rifle with him, but left it at Denton’s.</p>

<p>Still he had all the information that was necessary,
and winding his way across the hay field, got
out of sight of the house and then legged it for
town as fast as he could go. He was puffing when
he reached the village, and he stopped to get his
breath. As he stood in the shade of an arching elm,
the village constable came by and hailed him.</p>

<p>“Got any more tramps up your sleeve?” he asked
facetiously.</p>

<p>“No, I got something better than that this time,”
answered Dick. “I have three bank robbers for
you.”</p>

<p>The constable thought that Dick was joking, and
was about to make some humorous reply, when he
noticed that Dick was in dead earnest.</p>

<p>“You really serious?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Never more so in my life,” answered Dick, and
in a few brief sentences imparted his information to
the constable.</p>

<p>“Now what’s the next step?” asked Dick, as he
finished telling his story.</p>

<p>“Well, things are breaking lucky for us. I telephoned
the sheriff after you brought in that other
chap, and he said he’s starting right for here in his
tin flivver. That was just before noon, and allowing
him plenty of time along the road, he ought to
be here any minute now. He’s only about forty-five
miles from here. Let’s get back to the lockup and
wait for him.”</p>

<p>This they did, and had barely gotten inside when
they heard a motor engine come to a coughing stop
outside and in walked the sheriff with one of his
deputies. He recognized Dick instantly, for he had
been at the head of the party the night that the
smuggler band had been surrounded and captured.</p>

<p>The constable asked Dick to relate the occurrences
of the morning beginning with the capture of
the tramp and the subsequent developments that
warned them of the attempt that was to be made
that night.</p>

<p>The sheriff took in the whole talk without interruption,
and then quickly made his plans.</p>

<p>“If any other person than this fellow had told
me such a wild story, I’d be laughing yet; but I’ve
seen a little of the work of this boy and his two
companions, and so I’m taking a chance that he
hasn’t been dreaming. You’re sure these are the
same fellows you had a run-in with down in Cumberland
county, are you?” he asked, for Dick had
told them how they had first known of the tramps.</p>

<p>“Sure I’m sure,” said Dick indignantly. “Do
you think I’m spinning tales just to hear myself
talk?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Dick, don’t get hot,” laughed
the sheriff. “I’m just getting the lay of the land,
that’s all. Now here’s what we’ll do. I have
Brown, my deputy, with me here, and the constable
will make three. We’d better get one more man,
Constable, just to be on the safe side. Who can
you get?”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s Bud Harkins, who takes my job
when I’m off on business, or on a little vacation.
I can have him here in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“All right; be off and bring him here, and say
nothing of what it’s all about. That will make us
four, one more than the other outfit.”</p>

<p>Dick had been listening to this in a surprised sort
of a way.</p>

<p>Suddenly he burst out: “Four? Where do I
come in?”</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve done your share already, and
there’s no need for you to be putting yourself in
danger needlessly,” answered the sheriff.</p>

<p>“Say, that isn’t hardly fair. Here I get this tip,
and then I’m to be cheated of the fun of being in at
the end,” protested the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Might as well let him be the fifth man, Sheriff,”
said the deputy. “He and his friends are pretty
solid headed kids, and they were with us, you
remember, when we rounded up Green and his gang
first time.”</p>

<p>The sheriff debated with himself for a moment,
and then gave in.</p>

<p>“All right, another person in the party won’t
hurt any.”</p>

<p>Dick gave the deputy a grateful look, and said he
had some other business to transact, and so would
hop off and do that, and would be back at the little
police station in plenty of time to join the capturing
party.</p>

<p>“Take your time. We won’t gather here till
about ten o’clock, and then we can slip around and
take cover near the store and await the coming of
the outfit. Don’t let anyone see you coming here,
if you can help it, tonight,” answered the sheriff.</p>

<p>Dick hopped out and started for the lean-to in
the woods. The business that he wanted to transact
was to see if the camera trap had been sprung, and
if so to bring the film back to town with him and
develop it before it was time to join the sheriff’s
party.</p>

<p>It was a hiking afternoon for Dick, and he
thought that he must have walked nearly a score of
miles that day in the hot sun. But Dick could put
on speed when the occasion demanded it, and this
was certainly such an occasion.</p>

<p>He glanced at the sky from time to time. It was
still bright and cloudless, and he indulged in several
little chuckles as he thought of the gentle chaffing
that he would give Aunt Abbie about her “cat
barometer” that evening.</p>

<p>He retrieved his rifle at Denton’s and then at a
half trot made for the woods.</p>

<p>It was cooler walking under the trees, and he
kept up a swift pace, watching carefully as he
walked, so that he would not be surprised by any
one.</p>

<p>He did not meet a person on his way to the lean-to,
and as he approached the brush shack, redoubled
his vigilance. There was no sign of anyone around,
and keeping his rifle in a handy position, he made
his way to the place they called home while in the
woods.</p>

<p>Dick stepped over the trap carefully, for in the
event that no one had been there, he did not want
to have a snap of himself taken, and thereby necessitate
some minutes in resetting the trap.</p>

<p>He went directly to the bush screen, and looked.</p>

<p>Then he gave a whoop of delight. The little
lever of the lens had been pulled down.</p>

<p>Carefully he took the camera out of its hiding
place among the branches, and turned the roll so
that a new film was exposed. He knew from the
numbers on the little peekhole that there were three
more exposures on the roll, and so to use them up,
rather than develop them blank, he snapped the
brush lean-to from three different positions, thinking
that the folks at home would be interested in
seeing what kind of a place they lived in while in
the forests.</p>

<p>Then pocketing his camera, he cast a last look
around the lean-to and set out for the village and
Aunt Abbie’s house.</p>

<p>He had gone less than five hundred yards when
the sky began to darken, and in a few minutes the
big rain drops were pattering down through the
branches of the trees.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered,” he muttered aloud. “If
Aunt Abbie wasn’t right. Believe me, next time I
want to know what the weather is, I’m going to
hunt me up a cat and observe his actions for awhile.
I’m due for a nice wetting now.”</p>

<p>He wound a large bandanna handkerchief
around his neck to keep out the wet, and pulled
his coat collar up. Then he broke into a long lope,
that would take him over the ground at a fair rate
of speed, and yet not be tiring.</p>

<p>The rain increased in force, and soon he was
pretty thoroughly drenched. He wished he had his
rubber poncho with him, but that was strapped to
his knapsack, safely tucked away at Denton’s store,
nearly four miles away. There was nothing to do
but get wet, thought Dick philosophically, and he
put his best food forward. He had cheerful visions
of Aunt Abbie’s warm house and a good hot supper,
for the rain was cooling off the heated air like so
many monster electric fans.</p>

<p>He reached Denton’s store at last, and getting his
knapsack and refusing the postmaster’s invitation
to stay and get dry, made his way to Aunt Abbie’s.</p>

<p>“Good land o’ liberty,” said the old lady, when
she saw Dick’s condition. “Come right out to the
kitchen stove, and get those wet things off. Lucky
there’s some old clothes belonging to my youngest
son upstairs, and you can put ’em on till yours get
dry.”</p>

<p>Dick protested that he wanted nothing more than
a chair by the stove, for a wetting more or less was
nothing to him; but the old lady wouldn’t hear of
it, and to humor her, Dick told her to go and get
the clothes and he would wear them.</p>

<p>“By the way, Aunt Abbie, I take back all the
laughing I did at your ‘cat barometer’ this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I knew you would. Thomas Jones has never
failed me yet,” and she bustled out to get the dry
clothes.</p>

<p>In a short time she was back with them.</p>

<p>“These ought to fit you pretty well, my boy was
about your size when he had them. Now hurry up,
for Mr. Everett has waked up, and said he’d be
right down to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Aunt Abbie left the kitchen, and Dick made
haste to get into the dry clothes, for although he
was used to being wet, he did not deny that the dry
apparel was mighty comfortable.</p>

<p>Ruth’s grandfather soon appeared on the scene,
and his first anxious question was for news of his
granddaughter.</p>

<p>Dick told him the whole story, and did his best
to comfort the old man by telling that Garry rarely
failed on a mission.</p>

<p>“Besides, it seems to be our fate to overcome the
evil schemes of that half breed, and this time ought
to be no exception. I’ve a hunch also that LeBlanc’s
race is pretty nearly run, and we are due to turn
him over to the law before we finish our work
here.”</p>

<p>Dick’s optimism transferred itself in a measure
to the old man, who said philosophically:</p>

<p>“Well, the only thing to do is to wait, I suppose,
until Garry gets back, either with her or with news.
All my faith is pinned on him, and I feel he won’t
fail.”</p>

<p>After supper, Dick asked Aunt Abbie if she had
a closet that had an electric light in it, and found
to his delight that she had.</p>

<p>He borrowed some flat dishes from her, and then
went to the closet she indicated and proceeded to
make a darkroom of it. There was a flat-topped
trunk there, and this he converted into a table.</p>

<p>In the flat dishes he put the necessary water, and
then from his knapsack got the hypo and developer
and a piece of red cloth that he had bought for just
such a purpose.</p>

<p>This red cloth he twisted around the bulb of the
electric light, and in this way made his darkroom.
Requesting Aunt Abbie to turn off the lights in the
room, he entered the closet and proceeded to prepare
his developer and fixing bath.</p>

<p>Dick was no mean hand at developing pictures,
and he did the job speedily but carefully. After
the necessary developing, he left the developed negatives
in the water for several minutes, sloshing
them around occasionally to wash them free of all
the acid that was used in developing them. Then
he let them dry somewhat, and held them up to the
ruby light he made with the red cloth. The negative
showed the upright figure of a man, but he
could not make out who it was.</p>

<p>It would be necessary to make prints. Having
finished with his developing, he went out of the
closet and turned on the light in the outer room.</p>

<p>“Now, Aunt Abbie, can I bother you for one
more thing?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, a dozen more if you want
them. What is it now?” she replied.</p>

<p>“I’d like a small piece of glass and a flat piece of
wood. I am going to try and print some pictures,
but have no printing frame; although with the two
things mentioned, I can improvise one that will do
the work.”</p>

<p>Aunt Abbie directed him to the cellar, and he
rummaged around until he found a piece of glass
that was of the size he wanted. It was evidently
one that had been procured to mend a light in the
cellar window which he observed was broken. Then
he found a board, and proceeded to saw it to the
same size as the glass. He now had the principal
parts of the frame.</p>

<p>All that remained now to do was to hinge the
board and the glass, and this he did with a piece of
insulating tape from his ever ready knapsack. It
was some that had been bought for the purpose of
repairing the telephone lines when they were on
the forest fire patrol, when they had first entered
the woods.</p>

<p>Dick then retired to the darkroom, and setting
his negative against a piece of sensitized paper, inserted
the two between the glass and the wood.
Then holding the other end firmly together between
his thumb and fingers, held the improvised frame
with the glass up to the electric light from which
had been removed the red cloth.</p>

<p>Dick was familiar enough with printing to
“read” the paper as it developed. This was then
put into the printing bath and soon the picture appeared.
When it was finished, Dick stared at it in
amazement; for instead of the features of Jean
LeBlanc, which he firmly expected to see, he noted
that it was not Jean, but his brother, Baptiste!</p>

<p>“I might have remembered that they would probably
be together,” he thought, as he remembered
that Baptiste had been in the motor launch, by the
aid of which Jean had escaped from the lumber
camp. “Well, that leaves still two to be disposed
of, for the tramps and Lafe Green will be taken
tonight.”</p>

<p>He cleaned up after his work of developing and
printing, and then looking at his watch, found it
was nearly time to be starting for the rendezvous
with the sheriff and the constable.</p>

<p>“Where’s Phil?” asked Aunt Abbie. “I thought
he would be around for supper tonight.”</p>

<p>“He went off to Coldenham to do a little investigating,”
answered Dick, “and there was some likelihood
of his not being back tonight, unless he could
get a conveyance to bring him. There’s nothing to
worry about, however,” said Dick lightly, not knowing
of the accident that had befallen his comrade.</p>

<p>At the police station, he found that all the men
of the party had already arrived. The sheriff stated
that they would wait for about one hour and then
proceed singly or in pairs to the general store and
postoffice. Here they would take positions in hiding
and wait for the approach of the raiders.</p>

<p>“We’ll let them get in the store so that we can
catch them red-handed, and that will give us
enough to keep them in prison for a good while to
come. Also, it will cause the re-arrest of Lafe
Green, who, to my mind, should never have been
let out on bail. This second offense will forfeit his
right to asking bail again, and that will clean up
the last of a bad gang in these parts,” said the
sheriff.</p>

<p>The hour passed quickly, while Dick told of some
of the events that took place at the lumber camp.</p>

<p>“After we get through with this job, I think I’ll
make it a point to go after LeBlanc and get him
proper. He should not be at large, for he’s a
dangerous person as well as a criminal,” remarked
the sheriff.</p>

<p>Dick mentally agreed with him, as he thought of
the several narrow escapes that he and his friends
had had from The Bear, as LeBlanc liked to call
himself.</p>

<p>The start was made, and they arrived at the general
store.</p>

<p>There the sheriff stationed them in spots where
they could observe the store and yet be in hiding
themselves.</p>

<p>“They’ll probably approach from the woods there
where you say you followed them Dick, and will
likely get in through the back of the store, as I happen
to remember there’s a window there.”</p>

<p>They waited nearly an hour, a long, slow, dragging
hour, before the approach of Green and his
two evil companions.</p>

<p>Then there was a slight hitch that threatened
their plans for a moment. Instead of all of them
entering the store, Lafe Green effaced himself
against the side of the store in the shadows, evidently
to act as lookout while the others plied their
nefarious occupation.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get up on him unawares,” whispered
the sheriff to Dick, who was standing by him.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we draw back a bit and then approach
him from the other corner. We can creep
along in front of the porch there, and take him by
surprise. He would only be expecting to see some
straggler approach up the street, and would not
think of anyone creeping up on him,” suggested
Dick.</p>

<p>“Good an idea as any, suppose we try it,” whispered
the sheriff.</p>

<p>They followed out the idea, and taking several
minutes in order to make no sound, crept up on the
unsuspecting Green.</p>

<p>“Put ’em up, Green, and don’t let out a yip, or
I’ll blow the daylight through you,” whispered the
sheriff sibilantly.</p>

<p>Then he and Dick straightened up, leveling their
firearms at Green. Green was so taken by surprise
that he was only able to gasp.</p>

<p>“Now, Dick, round up the boys while I watch this
fellow,” ordered the sheriff.</p>

<p>Dick hastened to do his bidding, and in a trice
the other members of the party were at the sheriff’s
side. Green had already been handcuffed, and
warning him to make no sound, the party moved
towards the window in the rear of the store where
the tramps had made their entrance.</p>

<p>Bidding the constable guard Green, the capturing
party crept toward the cubbyhole office.</p>

<p>Everything was going according to schedule,
when the constable’s assistant stumbled against a
crate, barking his shins severely, and forgetting the
necessity for quietness, let out a muttered imprecation.</p>

<p>Instantly the tramps wheeled from their work,
and making out the forms of the sheriff and his
men, let loose with a volley of shots from their
revolvers.</p>

<p>There was the sound of a falling body, and a
groan from the sheriff’s deputy. Dick was about
to rush to his assistance, when he called:</p>

<p>“Never mind me, just got me in the leg. Get
the men.”</p>

<p>The tramps had snapped out their light, and so
offered no mark for the guns of the authorities of
the law. Flashes of orange flame pierced the darkness
as the sheriff fired at the spot where the tramps
had been working. Finally there was a rush of
feet, and the sheriff fired in the direction of the
sound.</p>

<p>There was a cry of pain from one of the tramps,
and then a crash as one hurled himself through the
open window.</p>

<p>Dick was the nearest to the window, and in a
flash had followed the lead set by the tramp. He
had dropped his rifle as he jumped, and was therefore
unarmed, while the tramp still had his revolver.</p>

<p>The refugee was only a few steps ahead of him,
and had slackened his stride for a moment to get
his bearings and determine in which direction he
should run.</p>

<p>This was Dick’s opportunity. Straight at the
tramp he ran, and with the practice borne of long
years on the football field,—for he was the star center
of the high school team,—dived straight at the
running man.</p>

<p>He hit him with a shock just above the knees,
and the man fell like a stricken ox. It will be
remembered that Dick was a heavy chap, and the
weight of his body added to the great force with
which he struck the man, was enough to knock the
wind entirely out of the tramp.</p>

<p>As the man lay there, stunned for the moment,
Dick possessed himself of the revolver, and with
this show of arms was able to force his prisoner to
march back to the spot where Lafe Green was being
held under guard.</p>

<p>There were no more shots from the store, and in
a moment or two the sheriff appeared with the constable
and the prisoner. He gave these in charge
of Dick and the man Hawkins, and then went back
to aid his deputy.</p>

<p>The fusilade of shots had drawn several half-dressed
men to the scene, and great was their astonishment
when they saw the sheriff’s party and their
prisoners.</p>

<p>The deputy was carried to the home of one of the
men, and a doctor called, but it was found that he
had sustained nothing more than a bad flesh wound.</p>

<p>Among those who had been attracted by the shots
was one Mr. Arthur, the president of the bank.</p>

<p>When he was informed that his little bank was
to have been the next scene of operations on the part
of the yeggman, and was told that Dick’s work had
prevented it, he shook hands with the boy heartily.</p>

<p>“It would have been a hard blow for me, for I
have more money than usual, since several mortgages
have been paid during the past few days.
You can be assured that I will not forget your brave
work,” he said.</p>

<p>“Looks like I lost out with you, young feller,”
said Lafe to Dick. “But let me tell you this.
There’s one more left to reckon with you, and I
guess he’ll wipe the slate clean for me!”</p>

</h2>

<p>The force of Phil’s fall had stunned him into
complete unconsciousness. He lay there for several
moments, and the force of the rain beating on his
face was evidently what revived him. He raised
himself to a sitting posture and stared about him.
Then his gradually dawning consciousness became
complete and he remembered his falling.</p>

<p>He felt the back of his head, expecting to find
that he had cut it badly, and was surprised to find
there was nothing but a bad lump.</p>

<p>Phil figured that his heavy scout hat had somewhat
broken the force of the blow. He felt of the
bump gingerly, for it was as sore as a burn. Then
he started to get on his feet, and groaned when the
weight of his body bore down on his right foot.</p>

<p>He sat down again quickly and unlaced his shoe-pack.</p>

<p>A quick examination told him he had either
sprained it, or at the least badly strained the ankle.
Snatching a handkerchief from his pocket, he tore
it into wide strips, and seeing that there was a puddle
of water in a depression near him, soaked the
strips in this, and then tightly bound the ankle,
which was beginning to swell since the support of
the shoe-pack had been removed.</p>

<p>Phil pulled the bandaging as tight as he could
bear, clenching his teeth as sharp twinges of pain
ran through his ankle and leg. Then he put his
shoe-pack on again, lacing it tightly as he could.</p>

<p>Another try at standing proved to be little more
successful than the first. He knew that it would be
foolish to attempt to walk on it, for that would
delay its recovery, and this was a time of all times
when he did not want to be laid up.</p>

<p>Phil knew that he had to get home somehow,
and yet he was a good ten miles, perhaps a trifle
more, from home. How to get there was the question.
Then he bethought himself of something.</p>

<p>He dragged himself to where he saw a sturdy
sapling with a forked branch on it. Taking his
knife, he whittled away laboriously at the bottom
until he had cut it down. He had judged what
would be the proper distance from his arm pit to
the ground, and began to cut there. Then he whittled
off the extra branches at the fork, leaving about
four inches of each fork projecting. In this way
Phil had fashioned a crutch for himself.</p>

<p>Using the crutch and hopping along on his one
good foot, he searched until he found a mate for it,
and after a few minutes more of work, had a serviceable
if not comfortable and handsome pair of
crutches. He then tore strips from the bottom of
his shirt, and with these padded the forks as well
as he could so that they would not chafe his armpits
too severely. By this time the rain had stopped,
and Phil decided that he would strike out for home
immediately.</p>

<p>He had no idea how long it would take him to get
home, but judged that it would be several hours,
as he would be lucky if he could make two miles an
hour with the crutches. After he had gotten the
knack of using the crutches, he made better time,
and after five miles of laborious and painful walking
along the uneven bed of the railroad, he came
to a pathway across the tracks that led up over the
bank.</p>

<p>Phil decided to investigate this a bit, and getting
up on the bank saw that the path widened considerably;
at least he figured that it did, since it was
too dark to see very plainly. He thought that it
might lead to some house, and decided he might
as well take enough time to follow it a little distance.</p>

<p>He was glad a few minutes later that he had
decided thus, for he saw a light gleaming a few
rods away. He hastened his steps, and came to a
small cottage.</p>

<p>He banged at the door, which was thrown open,
and a man stood there with an oil lamp in his hand.
Phil explained the situation to him, saying that he
had had a fall and sprained his ankle.</p>

<p>The cottager’s wife had followed her husband to
the door, and when she saw the wet, bedraggled
looking boy standing there, immediately invited
him in, and soon Phil was enjoying the warmth of
the fire.</p>

<p>He found out that the cottager was engaged in
cutting cordwood, for that section was hard wood,
rather than the usual spruce, hemlock and pine.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there is any way that I could get
back to town,” said Phil. “It is important that I
get there, as my friends will be worrying about me.
I would be glad to pay for the trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a horse and cart that I use to haul cordwood
in, but it’s pretty late tonight. Hadn’t you
better plan to stay here for the night and let me
take you in the morning?”</p>

<p>Phil noticed that the cottager was reluctant to
go out, and immediately made an attractive offer
for the drive, provided they could start out immediately.</p>

<p>“Where you staying in town?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“At a Mrs. Drysdale’s. She’s generally known
as Aunt Abbie in town, though, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, that’s a different matter altogether,”
said the cottager. “Aunt Abbie is kin to my wife,
and she’d raise fits if she found that a friend of
hers wasn’t obliged in any way possible. I’ll hitch
up the horse while Mother makes you a cup of hot
coffee, and you dry out a little, and then I’ll have
you there in no time at all.”</p>

<p>This was absolutely to Phil’s liking, and he
waited for the coffee to be made. When it was
ready he drank it gratefully, for the rain had
drenched him to the skin and chilled him completely.</p>

<p>On the way into town the cottager, whose name
Phil learned was Lorimer, asked several questions
about Phil, but none that caused Phil to have to be
evasive in answering.</p>

<p>At Aunt Abbie’s, he was ordered straight off to
bed, and only Phil’s violent protestations kept her
from sending for the doctor.</p>

<p>“Where’s Dick?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“He went gallivanting off on something he said
was important business nearly two hours ago, and
hasn’t come back yet. My goodness, for boys like
you, you seem to have a lot to do in the dead o’ the
night; but I guess it’s all right, it’s in a good
cause,” remarked Aunt Abbie in a doubtful tone.
“My, these last few nights I’ve been staying up till
all hours. Such excitement!”</p>

<p>She had no sooner finished speaking when there
was a knock at the door, and she went to open and
admitted Dick.</p>

<p>The chums greeted each other heartily, and
quizzed each other as to developments during their
respective missions.</p>

<p>Dick’s news was received with astonishment by
all present, and he was warmly congratulated for
his part in the successful night, although he modestly
disclaimed having done such a great deal.</p>

<p>“I certainly am glad to see that Green again
under lock and key,” said Mr. Everett. “I can’t
help but think he is the one who is at the bottom of
my misfortune; that is the threatening letters and
then the burning down of my house. That leaves
very few of that gang at large, now, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Just Jean LeBlanc, and he hasn’t much farther
to go,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“You forget one other, Phil,” put in Dick, “and
that reminds me to tell you that I think I know who
did the rattlesnake trick. I developed and printed
the picture that was caught by the camera trap, and
found that it was Jean’s brother, Baptiste.”</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten all about him, to tell you the
truth,” said Phil. “Well, if we can get one, the
other cannot be far away. Now let’s off to bed.
With the wetting and this uncomfortable ankle, I
am pretty tired.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s way beyond bedtime. All we can do
now is wait for the morrow and pray that good
news will come with it,” said Mr. Everett.</p>

<p>Phil had purposely said nothing of the startling
disclosures made by his afternoon’s work, but
waited until he and Dick had gone to their bedroom.
There, as he undressed and rebound his
ankle, he told Dick of the treachery on the part of
Simmons.</p>

<p>“I waited until I could come and advise with you
on the subject,” said Phil. “I thought at first of
going on to Coldenham, when my fall put an end
to that, and the best thing to do then seemed to be
to come back.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to advise,” returned Dick.
“I wish that Garry were here, so we could put the
matter up to him. I should say, though, that action
was needed. Now the sheriff is a sensible man, and
so I move that we put it up to him. We can see
him in the morning, that is we can if your ankle is
better, if not I’ll go alone, and bring him here.
Then we can follow his advice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s one other thing we can have
him do. He probably knows how to take a fingerprint
and he can take Lafe’s and those of the
tramps, and while we are not experts, they are
plain enough so that we can tell with a bit of study
whether or not they compare with the one on the
letter.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that, then. I’m going to turn in,”
remarked Dick, smothering a yawn.</p>

<p>“Same here. Goodnight,” answered Phil.</p>

<p>They had hardly gotten into bed, however, before
there came a knock at their door, and they
heard Aunt Abbie.</p>

<p>“There’s a Frenchman just came to the door and
says he has a message for you from Garry,” she
announced.</p>

<p>“I’ll be right down, tell him,” said Dick, hopping
out of bed as he spoke; and reaching for his clothes,
started to dress.</p>

<p>Dick dressed hastily and went to the front door.
When he opened it, he could see no one, and
stepped down onto the walk to look about.</p>

<p>He had barely done so, when he was seized by
the arm by someone who stepped out of the shrubbery
that lined the walk.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the man in French, and a second
appeared in his wake.</p>

<p>Dick recognized the voice. It was that of Baptiste
LeBlanc.</p>

<p>Certain capture stared Dick in the face. To call
for help would be of no avail, for there was no one
that could come to his aid quickly. He thought
swiftly and then acted.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, during their school year, a
Japanese boy had lived for a time in Colfax, the
home town of the boys, and was the marvel of the
town for his ability at jiu jitsu, the Japanese art of
wrestling. He had taught many of the boys some
of the simpler tricks of judo, as the art is often
called, and now Dick remembered these.</p>

<p>Snapping back with his foot, the heel of his
heavy shoe-pack caught the man standing in back
of him square on the shin.</p>

<p>Then when the other had come near him, he used
one of the holds taught him by the son of Nippon,
and sent the other flying.</p>

<p>The beauty of the art of jiu jitsu is that weight
and size of the opponent are never taken into consideration.
Knowing the proper method, a girl of
sixteen can throw a full-grown man several feet.</p>

<p>As everyone knows who has ever experienced it,
there are few things that hurt any more than a well-directed
blow on the shin. The force of the one
dealt Dick’s capturer was sufficient to make him
groan with pain, and loose his hold on the boy’s
arm.</p>

<p>Free of his captors, Dick figured that discretion
was the better part of valor in this case, and darted
back into the house, slamming the door shut, and
turning the key in the lock. Then he reached for
his rifle and went to the front window and saw the
pair sneaking off down the road.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Phil speedily.</p>

<p>“Nothing much; just Baptiste LeBlanc is on the
trail of yours truly.”</p>

</h2>

<p>We left Garry talking with the storekeeper at
Chester.</p>

<p>The storekeper had just described Jean LeBlanc
to him as having bought a liberal supply of provisions.
That meant that the tramp had not played
them false but had given a straight tip.</p>

<p>Having gotten all the desired information, Garry
bade the storekeeper goodnight and hastened back
to the hotel where he turned in.</p>

<p>LeBlanc already had twelve hours’ start on him,
and by morning it would be a full day, but there
was no use in Garry’s trying to go further that
night.</p>

<p>He would have a blind enough chase in broad
daylight, and he needed sleep so that he would be
fresh for the hard trail ahead.</p>

<p>Garry woke with the dawn and sprang from his
bed, determined to make every minute that day
count. He descended to breakfast, and after a
hasty meal asked the hotel owner if there was any
place there where he could hire a canoe for two or
three days.</p>

<p>“Sure there is; right here. My boy had one
that he used a lot, but he’s working in the city now,
and so it just lays there in the boathouse doing
nothing,” answered the hotel man.</p>

<p>Garry soon struck a bargain, and a reasonable one,
and the hotel man sent one of the loungers to show
him where it was.</p>

<p>He unshipped the canoe from its resting place,
and gave it a hasty examination to determine
whether or not it had sprung a leak anywhere from
its long disuse. It was a well-made Kennebec
canoe, however, and in sound condition.</p>

<p>Packing his knapsack and rifle securely in the
bow, Garry took his paddle and started out straight
across the river, which was not less than a quarter
of a mile wide at this point.</p>

<p>On the other side, he beached his canoe, and taking
one of the white strips he had prepared, tied it
to a branch, so that it was not conspicuous but
could be easily seen by anyone with whom arrangements
had been made to look for it.</p>

<p>Then he arranged the trail signal to show that he
was going down river. This consisted of three
stones. On the largest stone he placed a single
one, and then on the ground beside it was placed
one indicating the direction he was to take.</p>

<p>This done, he pushed out in the river again and
paddled down stream, always keeping a sharp lookout
along the banks.</p>

<p>At intervals of a quarter of a mile or so he would
beach the canoe and attach signals to guide his companions
should there be need of following him.</p>

<p>Several times he wondered if his hunch in going
to the place where the attempt to lay a railroad had
been started was wise. Then he reflected that he
had no stated course to pursue, hence following a
hunch was the only thing left to do. He was sure
of one fact, that LeBlanc had come that way. Then
this was the only likely place to come.</p>

<p>He would hardly take a captive to the Forest
Reserve; there was always the danger that he
would come upon a Ranger, and this reserve was
better patrolled than any other of the state woodlands,
for the government and not the state exercised
supervision. The Rangers here covered more
ground, for Garry had been told that they were all
mounted.</p>

<p>On the side of the river where the town lay, there
was no place where one could hide out very successfully,
for the timber growth there was mostly
hard wood, and there was constant cutting. Straggled
farms dotted that part of the country.</p>

<p>The only logical place, therefore, was the wild
land toward which Garry was heading. And, he
figured, what more likely place to make a start than
the old railroad. One could easily follow that, and
let circumstances decide on what course to pursue
as soon as the track came to an end.</p>

<p>Garry judged that he had paddled about ten
miles, when he came to a bit of beach, or rather a
spot where the growth had been cut away, leaving
a bare spot except for the scores of stumps that
dotted the land.</p>

<p>It has probably been the intention of the railroad
builders to make a slide here for the logs to be
rolled into the river. Garry headed the nose of his
craft into the bank, and hauled up the canoe. Since
he had determined to trek into the forest, he had to
secrete his canoe. He cast about for a good place,
and noting an extra thick undergrowth several
yards away, went to see if it was a practicable hiding
place.</p>

<p>Great was Garry’s surprise when he parted the
underbrush and found a birch-bark canoe already
hidden there. He crawled into the thick bushes to
make a closer examination of the craft.</p>

<p>The thought that instantly sprang to his mind
was that this was LeBlanc’s canoe. If such was
the case, Garry determined that it should be put out
of commission.</p>

<p>Still, supposing it belonged to some of the boys
that lived on the other side of the river? In that
case the destruction of the canoe would be rather a
mean trick to play.</p>

<p>Garry looked into the canoe and found some trash
left there. This appeared to be paper in which parcels
had been wrapped, and seemed to have been
only lately discarded. Looking closer, he noted the
twine that was used. It was a cheap twine composed
of red and white strands intermixed.</p>

<p>Immediately Garry remembered that this was the
sort of twine used by the storekeeper with whom he
had talked the night before, and who had told him
of selling supplies to a man that answered the description
of the halfbreed.</p>

<p>Garry reflected that it was better to be safe than
be sorry, and determined to disable the canoe. In
case it was the halfbreed’s, all well and good. If
it was that of some of the boys, he could leave word
with the hotel man and the storekeeper that he
would make good the damage.</p>

<p>There was something else to be considered.
Should he disable the canoe and should LeBlanc
come back, would it not immediately give warning
that he was being tracked, and cause him to turn in
his tracks and trace his pursuer?</p>

<p>Garry gave the matter several minutes’ thought,
and then the idea occurred to him. He could
disable the canoe by puncturing the innumerable “eyes”
that are frequent in birch bark—the little places
where a branch would later pierce though.</p>

<p>Hastily he took his pocket knife, one of the
Scout knives that was equipped with several tools,
among them being a sharp instrument that could
be used as a brad awl.</p>

<p>Working speedily, he plunged it through all the
eyes he could find. This would cause the canoe to
leak, and make it useless as a craft. There is only
one way to fix this, and that is one that requires a
great deal of time. It consists of making a slashwise
cut in the bark through the “eye” and sealing
this down with hot pitch. The damage that Garry
had done would take a good while to repair properly,
and if it was LeBlanc’s canoe, it might hinder
him in making an escape at some time.</p>

<p>The easy manner in which he found LeBlanc’s
canoe was a warning to him. He carefully obliterated
all traces of having been there, and returned to
his canoe. Getting aboard again, he paddled down
the river about a hundred yards, till he came to a
rocky bank. There he succeeded in bringing his
canoe up on to the land, and as the growth was
thick here also, had no trouble in finding a perfect
place of concealment.</p>

<p>This done, he scrambled through the undergrowth
back to the spot where he had first landed.
Hitching up his knapsack, and looking to his rifle, he set
off into the woods. The track had been laid for
some little distance, and piles of ties lay along the
track. After a matter of perhaps half a mile, the
trackage ceased, and from there on was only a trail
marked by the triangular stick such as surveyors
use to mark out the particular line that their engineering
matter requires.</p>

<p>Garry knew now that extreme caution was required.
Provided LeBlanc had come this way, there
was every possibility that he might be returning
over the same route.</p>

<p>For a matter of two miles Garry walked, peering
ahead of him, and straining his ears to catch the
slightest sound.</p>

<p>Finally he came to a little natural clearing in the
midst of the brush and trees, and saw ashes. Someone
has made a campfire there, and not very long
ago, either. Woodsmen can always tell within a
short time, just how long since a fire has been used.
It is almost impossible to describe, and can only be
done intuitively or by long practice.</p>

<p>Garry decided that this fire had been built not
more than a day ago, and a tin tomato can that had
been thrown to one side, had barely corroded from
exposure to the elements.</p>

<p>He was on the trail, but where did it lead? And
was it made by the quarry he was seeking?</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch and saw that it was
almost eleven o’clock, the hour when he had promised
to open his receiving station and wait for a
message from his chums. He decided that this was
as good a spot as any, and unpacked the apparatus
from his knapsack, adjusting and extending the
rods from which his aerial could hang.</p>

<p>As he looked about for a good place to stand his
rod, he caught a glint of something bright in the
tangled grass near him.</p>

<p>He bent and picked it up, and was amazed to find
that it was a small gold locket. Hastily he opened
it, and there staring at him from the two compartments,
were pictures of Ruth and her grandfather!</p>

<p>Garry almost shouted with glee. They had come
this way, and the next step was to determine in
which direction they had gone.</p>

<p>That, however, must wait for a moment, for he
wanted his chums to know that he was safe, and
hence must wait for a time for a message from
them.</p>

<p>But when he spread out his apparatus, a pang
struck him. Part of the detector, the most essential
part of the receiving apparatus, was missing!</p>

<p>Garry examined it closely and saw that it had
been broken; and when he took thought, he remembered
the haste in which the boys had packed their
knapsacks, his among them, when they left the
lumber camp some days before.</p>

<p>Inwardly the boy berated himself for his stupidity
in setting out on this search without first seeing
that all his apparatus was in perfect order.</p>

<p>The detector, sometimes known to users of the
radio as a “cat’s whisker,” is a thin wire with a
point attached to it, extending from the sounding
posts to a piece of galena or silicon. This detector
is used for this reason: The voice waves that are
sent out through a radio transmitter are too faint
to be heard by the human ear unaided by a mechanical
apparatus.</p>

<p>The detector or “whisker” is moved about on the
silicon until it strikes a sensitive spot, and in this
way the air waves are brought into proper tune,
and may be heard through the receiving ’phones.</p>

<p>Attached to the end of the wire that is fixed to
the baseboard is either a point, welded to the
brass wire that leads to the cup holding the galena
crystals, or else a point is carefully fashioned on the
end of the wire to the same sharpness as a needle.</p>

<p>In the case of Garry’s detector, both the point
and the entire wire were missing.</p>

<p>Somehow he must fix this, else his friends would
immediately set out in search of him, and that perhaps
at a time when they had important work to do
at Hobart concerning the mission they had embarked
on.</p>

<p>But how was he to repair a part of a radio telephone,
that most delicate instrument, while he was
out here in the wilds? It would be a hard enough
task in the village, for there were no stores where
radio equipment could be bought.</p>

<p>Garry, however, was not one to give up hopelessly
on anything. He set his wits to work to
think up some way in which the detector could be
fixed. A search of his knapsack revealed nothing
that could be substituted for the original whisker.</p>

<p>He knew enough about the apparatus to know
what would be needed. First there was a piece of
brass wire, and that must be sharpened to a needle
point.</p>

<p>As he thought of the words “needle point,” he
was struck by a brilliant idea, and gave a soft
whoop at the thought that it might work.</p>

<p>In his knapsack was a small “housewife” that his
mother had given him just before he set out for
the big woods at the start of the summer. He resurrected
this, and from it drew a large needle.</p>

<p>There was part of the battle won, but there were
still two other necessary things to obtain. One was
the brass wire, and the other was a method of welding
or soldering it to the needle.</p>

<p>He rummaged through his belongings, in the
vain hope of finding some bit of wire that would
answer the purpose, but could find nothing. Desperately
he glanced at his watch. It was already
twenty minutes after eleven, and the boys were
probably trying vainly to talk with him.</p>

<p>As he looked at his watch, a thought struck him.</p>

<p>Presto; here was the brass wire. It would mean
sacrificing the use of his watch for a time, but that
could be easily dispensed with. He unscrewed the
back of his watch, and ruthlessly took out the mainspring,
which was a small coil of thin brass, not a
wire exactly, but something that would answer the
purpose just as well. His screw driver that he carried
in the knapsack was too clumsy for such work
as tinkering with a watch, so he used the point of
his knife blade instead.</p>

<p>Getting the mainspring out was a matter of a few
seconds only. Now remained only to think of some
ingenious way to solder the brass coil to the needle.
In his search through the knapsack he had thrown
much of the contents on the ground near him, and
in looking these over, in the search for inspiration,
his eyes lighted on his fishing tackle.</p>

<p>There was the final thing needed. From the
tackle book, where he kept his flies, he undid a little
flap that covered a pocket, and drew out a split lead
sinker. This was just what he needed for soldering
the coil to the needle.</p>

<p>With his pliers he bent the end of the coil tightly
about the center of the needle, and widening the
split in the shot with his knife, slipped it over the
needle where it was held to the brass coil.</p>

<p>Using the handle of his knife, he carefully
pounded the sinker until it held of its own accord.
Soldering was now a simple matter.</p>

<p>Garry lighted a small fire, and when the dry
branches had burned to coals, thrust the screwdriver
into the glowing bed.</p>

<p>“That spoils a good screwdriver,” thought Garry,
“but at least it’s in a good cause.”</p>

<p>As any boy knows that has ever used tools, heating
a screwdriver, if it is a good one, ruins the
temper and makes it easy to break when struggling
with a refractory screw.</p>

<p>As soon as the blade had gotten sufficiently
heated, he applied it quickly to the lead sinker and
caused it to melt and fuse around the needle. Two
or three applications of the hot screwdriver were
necessary before the job could be called complete,
and then Garry sat back and surveyed his work
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Now remained only the biggest question of all.
Would this crude contrivance work? Garry felt
that it would, since it followed in principle the theory
of the detector.</p>

<p>The quickest way to find out if it was workable,
of course, was to try it out, and this he immediately
did.</p>

<p>Noting that all the rest of the radio outfit was
in good condition, he adjusted the headpieces and
tuned up back and forth over the tuning coil to get
the proper range. Soon he heard frequent buzzes
in the receivers and knew that everything was all
right. Now came the crucial test of the detector.
He moved the needle point around on the silicon
and soon was rewarded by getting the proper induction,
and distinctly heard a voice. The forest-made
detector worked!</p>

<p>The voicing was chanting over and over again:</p>

<p>“Boone, Garry Boone. Calling Garry Boone.”</p>

<p>Garry laughed to himself as he thought how
much it sounded like a bellboy in a hotel paging one
of the guests.</p>

<p>Turning to his sender he called.</p>

<p>“Boone talking.”</p>

<p>This he repeated at intervals, and after a few
minutes, in which he divined that Phil and Dick
were probably working their tuning coil, he established
connection.</p>

<p>But the connection was faulty, and he was afraid
that at any moment the detector would fail to work.
So he called briefly:</p>

<p>“Have found a clue to Ruth and am on her trail.
Am safe. Tell Mr. Everett everything is coming
out O. K. What news have you?”</p>

<p>From the other end came this startling, to Garry,
news:</p>

<p>“Simmons arrested this morning, and——”</p>

<p>Then all became silent. Only an indistinct buzzing
came into the receivers. He worked his tuning
coil back and forth, but brought no results. Then
he tried switching the “cat’s whisker” to another
spot on the cup of silicon, and found that this, too,
was futile.</p>

<p>Something had evidently gone wrong with his
apparatus. So after a few minutes more of vain
attempt to establish connection again, he gave it up
as a bad job.</p>

<p>However, the vital thing had been accomplished.
He had informed his chums that he was safe, thereby
freeing their minds from worry, and he knew
that they were on the job at their end. Also his
message would prove of great cheer to Ruth’s
grandfather and Aunt Abbie.</p>

<p>He could not, of course, understand what his
friends had meant by Simmons being arrested.
Simmons was the postal inspector, and should be
making arrests, rather than be subject to seizure
himself.</p>

<p>There was no use, though, in racking his head
to try and puzzle out the situation. There was still
the important part of his work ahead of him.</p>

<p>He felt hungry and decided to make a hasty
meal before going any further. He produced from
his supplies enough stuff for a cold lunch, and was
wondering if it would be worth while to search for
a few minutes for a spring.</p>

<p>Garry figured that five minutes could make no
great difference, and looking around for moist
ground that would denote the proximity of a
spring, advanced a short distance into the woods.
He had not gone far when he heard the murmur of
water, and pushing ahead, came to a fair-sized
brook.</p>

<p>Quickly he noted that there were footprints on
the soft bit of shore, and bent to examine them.
After some scrutiny he could make out distinctly
at least three sets of prints. One set seemed to be
made by moccasins, for the prints were blurred and
indistinct, and another set was evidently left there
by some man who wore a pair of shoes with heels.</p>

<p>What made Garry’s heart beat quickly, was the
sight of the third set of prints that were of a certainty
made by a girl.</p>

<p>The two sets of male footprints of course denoted
two men, and since it was a foregone conclusion
that the moccasined walker was LeBlanc,
Garry wondered who his companion could be.</p>

<p>He searched about for more prints in an endeavor
to find which way the tracks led, but they
soon broke back onto the hard ground, covered with
countless thousands of pine needles and spears from
the spruce trees.</p>

<p>He was about to give up the search and debate
with himself as to what course to pursue, when he
saw, lying among the pine needles, a dress button.</p>

<p>Garry seized it eagerly. It looked like an ornamental
button from a waist or dress. Since it lay
some little distance from where he had found the
footprints, it must mean that the girl and her captor
had come this way.</p>

<p>It was new looking, and was undoubtedly
dropped there not very long before the time he
found it. Had it been there for some time it would
show it had been exposed to the rain and ground.</p>

<p>Filling his collapsible bucket with water, he hurried
back, and having made his coffee, hastily ate
his meal. The wireless was then dismantled and
along with the other contents of the knapsack repacked
quickly.</p>

<p>Shouldering his knapsack, and stamping out the
remains of the fire, also removing, as far as possible,
any trace of having eaten at the spot, Garry
made his way back to the place he had found the
button.</p>

<p>The discovery had shaped his course for him. It
was probable that the trail led up the brook. If
LeBlanc had some hideout in the woods, what was
more natural than having it near a brook, both for
the fact that it was a supply of water and a place
where a certain amount of food could be obtained,
since Garry, with an angler’s instinct, had mentally
decided that the brook abounded in fat trout.</p>

<p>The final reason for believing this to be the
proper trail lay in the fact that it was less brushy
and thick along the bank of the brook, making it
easier walking. Garry walked along for some distance,
keeping his eyes glued to the ground in the
hope of finding “sign” of some sort to show that his
quarry had passed that way.</p>

<p>With a muffled exclamation he bent to the
ground and picked up—another button.</p>

<p>Carefully comparing it with the other, he found
them to be exactly alike. Then it dawned on him
that Ruth in some manner must have been able to
detach them from her clothing and was dropping
them for the purpose of leaving a trail behind her.</p>

<p>Garry wondered if the locket might not also
have been purposely dropped with the same idea in
view. The discovery made him hasten his steps,
and he fairly tore off yard after yard. The walking
was none too easy, for it was not the soft flooring
of the forest such as he had patrolled on his
father’s land. Here the way was rough and uneven,
and as he walked he noted that the grade tended to
rise, and thought it would shortly get into hilly
country.</p>

<p>Sometime later he found a third, and then a
fourth button. After that he found no more. Each
time that he had made a discovery, he had marked
the spot carefully and made short detours from the
path, to see if at any time the party had turned off.</p>

<p>This had naturally taken a great deal of precious
time, and peering up into the sky through the
branches of the trees, he discovered that he could
not see the sun, and judged that it must be at least
five in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Garry had gone nearly two miles after finding
the last button, and since he could find no more,
wondered if he had lost the trail. By the time he
stopped to consider this, he found he was at the
beginning of a sharp rise in the ground, and figured
that he was at the foot of a hill. A few minutes’
hard walking convinced him of the truth of this
thought, and he came to what was evidently the
top of a high knoll or hill.</p>

<p>There was one thing left to do, and that was to
climb a tree and sweep the surrounding country
through his glasses in the hope of finding a clue.
The brook which he had been following stopped at
a spring almost at the top of the little hill. This
spring naturally was the source of the brook, which
likely ended in the Penocton River.</p>

<p>He selected the highest tree he could find, and
since the branches did not begin for some feet from
the ground, had recourse to the method he and his
chums used.</p>

<p>This consisted of taking a long piece of cord, or
better still a stout wire, and circling it around his
person and the tree. By alternately lifting this and
bracing his heels against the tree, he was able to
edge himself up inch by inch till he could reach one
of the branches.</p>

<p>From then on climbing was a simple matter. He
reached the top of the tree, going as high as he
dared before it would bend with his weight. He
had shown wisdom in picking the particular tree he
had, for it towered above its fellows for several
feet.</p>

<p>Garry found he had a good view of the country
around him. He was surprised to note that he had
made a considerable climb without noticing how
great it was, for although he was conscious while
walking that he was on rising ground, he had no
idea that the gradient was so steep. To one side
he could see a little depression, and then a sharp
rise that led to a series of ever mounting hills.</p>

<p>At another point there was a depression as
though some ravine existed there. He watched
this spot fixedly for some minutes, for the sun was
just dropping over the horizon, and the vicinity
was not perfectly visible. Then he gave a sharp
exclamation. Rising from the ravine, or depression,
or whatever it was, was a thin spiral of smoke,
that grew a little thicker after he had watched it
for some moments.</p>

<p>He fished in his pocket and drew out his compass,
noted the exact point from which the smoke
seemed to come, and then made haste to descend
the tree, scratching his hands in his hurry to get to
the bottom.</p>

<p>He got to the ground by “bending” one of the
limbs. This is a simple matter, as nearly every
boy knows. It consists of crawling out on one of
the branches until the weight of the body begins to
pull it toward the earth. The farther one goes the
nearer the earth comes to the limb, until one can
drop off and let the limb fly back to its original
position.</p>

<p>Calculating the direction by referring to the compass,
he set off in the direction of the place from
which he had seen the smoke emanating.</p>

<p>While in the treetop he had estimated that it
must lay almost a mile away, and the going was
hard. The brush was tangled and thick, and the
ground rocky. Where there were scattered rocks,
the roots of the trees projected as though coming
in search of nourishment that was denied them in
the rocky soil.</p>

<p>Here and there he noted places where the brush
had evidently been torn away to allow some one to
pass through.</p>

<p>After almost an hour of tiresome toil, he approached
a little clearing, and then became exceedingly
cautious and wary. He could see that there
was a slight ravine there, with an entrance between
two great rocks.</p>

<p>Creeping to this entrance he peered in, and saw
that a crude shack had been erected at one end.
He must approach the shack without knowing who
was in it, or how many might be there. He
divested himself of his knapsack, sticking it in
back of a pile of brush, so that should anyone approach,
they would not be warned of the presence
of a stranger.</p>

<p>Then with his rifle grasped firmly in his hand,
he walked slowly and noiselessly to the door of the
shack. He half expected to be challenged by LeBlanc
before he could reach the door.</p>

<p>No one halted his approach, however, and he
came up to the door. It was half ajar, and holding
his rifle so that he could instantly cover anyone, he
threw open the door.</p>

<p>There he saw a sight that made his heart leap.</p>

<p>In one corner of the shack was Ruth, tied hand
and foot, and a dirty rag stuffed in her mouth for
a gag. In addition to the bonds on her wrists and
ankles, she was tied to a projecting log.</p>

<p>He ran over to the girl, whipping his knife from
his pocket as he did so.</p>

<p>It was the work of a moment only to cut the
bonds that tied her and release the gag from her
mouth. Ruth let him free her, and then stood erect
for a moment, and being only a girl, dropped over
in a dead faint.</p>

<p>The inside of the cabin was nearly dark, and he
was searching about wildly to see if there was any
water within, when he heard a muffled groan from
another corner.</p>

<p>Garry ran to the corner and was astonished to
see that a man, tied and gagged in the same manner
that Ruth had been, was lying there.</p>

<p>The boy hesitated for a moment before releasing
him, and then reflected that he could not be inimical
since such drastic measures had been taken to render
him helpless.</p>

<p>His indecision was only momentary, and then
with a few swift strokes of his knife, he freed the
man.</p>

<p>The stranger rose weakly to his feet, and for a
moment could not be understood. Garry thought
that he must have been gagged for some little time,
as his thick speech indicated that his tongue was
probably swollen.</p>

<p>“Guess you came just about in time,” he finally
managed to utter.</p>

<p>“From the looks of things here you’re right,”
answered Garry. “But who are you?”</p>

<p>Then came the astonishing answer:</p>

<p>“Name’s Simmons. I’m a United States postal
inspector!”</p>

<h2 id='chXI'
  class='chapter' title='XI. GARRY FINDS RUTH'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI</span><br/>
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>GARRY FINDS RUTH</span>
</h2>

<p>“You’re who?” asked Garry, so astonished that
he almost stuttered.</p>

<p>“Simmons, I told you; but first, have you any
water?”</p>

<p>Garry had been so flustered by Ruth’s fainting
that he had forgotten his canteen, which lay outside
with his knapsack. He dashed out of the
shack and in a moment returned with it.</p>

<p>He gave the man a little, cautioning him to be
careful and not drink too much. The man realized
the sense of this, and drank sparingly.</p>

<p>The boy then turned his attention to Ruth, and
after spattering some of the water on her face,
forced a small quantity of it between her lips, and
then fell to chafing her and hands and wrists. In
a few moments the color returned to her face and
she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>She cast a frightened glance around, and then
seeing that Garry was standing over her, laughed
weakly.</p>

<p>“Guess that’s the first time I ever fainted in my
life. Oh, I’m so glad to see you, but I kept up
hope all the time that you and the boys would
come. Are they with you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m here alone; but that doesn’t matter as
long as you’re safe and sound. Just tell me one
thing. Who brought you here?”</p>

<p>“It was Jean LeBlanc,” answered Ruth.</p>

<p>“I was pretty sure it was,” said Garry, “I just
wanted corroboration.”</p>

<p>The man who called himself Simmons was stirring
around, easing his cramped muscles and restoring
the circulation to his arms and legs.</p>

<p>Now he approached Garry and said:</p>

<p>“Look, young chap, have you anything to eat
with you? I haven’t had a bite since yesterday
noon, and neither has this girl here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve plenty. Just wait until I get my
knapsack outside.” And Garry was about to get it,
when he was interrupted by Ruth.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry, too; but you aren’t going to stay in
this dreadful place another minute, are you? Can’t
we get away from her right now?”</p>

<p>“Guess that would be the wisest course, Miss,”
said the man. “But I’m pretty weak, and you must
be also. We couldn’t do much unless we had something
to fortify ourselves with. We must be a
good many miles away from civilization.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re about eight or nine miles all told
from the river, and it’s getting too dark to go wandering
back through the woods,” answered Garry.
Then as an afterthought he asked:</p>

<p>“Can you handle a gun, Mr. Simmons? I’m
calling you Simmons because you say that’s your
name; but later on I’m going to ask a lot of questions.”</p>

<p>“You bet I can,” was the quick response, “and
the first time I see that snaky Frenchman I’m going
to handle one if it’s handy.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s seemingly only one plausible entrance
to this place, and that’s by the mouth of this
ravine. You take the rifle and stand guard there,
and I’ll get some supper. After that we can decide
on the next move. From the mouth of this ravine
here you could pick off a half a dozen men should
they approach, and so we’ll be safe enough.”</p>

<p>This being settled, Garry went out, to return a
few moments later with his knapsack.</p>

<p>“Do you know if there’s any water anywhere
around here?”</p>

<p>“Why, the old Indian woman used to be gone
only a few moments and she’d come back with some
in that old tin pail there,” answered Simmons.</p>

<p>“The old who? But never mind; questions can
wait for a while,” and Garry took the pail and went
out. He found that there was a spring outside the
entrance. He filled his pail and hastened back to
the shack.</p>

<p>In a little while he had coffee, bacon and spider
bread cooking in the crude fireplace. A great log
had been thrown on that morning, he found, and it
was this that burned and smouldered through the
day, making the smoke that guided him to his destination.</p>

<p>Simmons kept watch while Garry prepared the
supper, and then Garry took his turn at watching
while the others ate. In turn he was relieved by
Simmons and made his own supper.</p>

<p>The meal over, they gathered at the mouth of the
ravine, and discussed the situation. First Garry
asked for an account of what had happened.</p>

<p>Simmons told his story.</p>

<p>“As I told you, my name is Simmons, and I’m
a postal inspector. I was detailed from Washington
several days ago to go to Hobart to investigate
alleged irregularities in the mail there, and reached
the town by nightfall. I got my supper at a restaurant
there, kept by a French chap, and was taking
a walk around just to get the lay of the land.</p>

<p>“I walked out of the town just a ways, and next
thing I knew, I was set on by three men, and
though I fought as best I could, I was overpowered.
They hustled me to a farm not very far from
the town, and kept me there for a couple of days.
Then one night I was bundled into an automobile
and carried some miles.</p>

<p>“When the auto left me, my captor made me
march at the point of a gun to the bank of a river.
My hands were tied behind me, and I could make
no break for liberty. It was night, and there was
never a person to be seen. The chap who was leading
me, a big, burly, black-haired Frenchman,
tripped me up when I got to the river bank and
proceeded to tie my feet and gag me. Then he disappeared
and came back after a while, and picked
me up as though I were a child—I’m not a very
hefty person anyway—and carried me to a canoe
on the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“He paddled over the river. I’m going to call
this chap LeBlanc. Isn’t that what you said his
name was, Miss? The same one that brought you
was the one that guided me here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was LeBlanc,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“Well, to make a long story short, I was brought
here and kept tied hand and foot. There was an
old Indian man and woman here, and they guarded
me. When they fed me, one hand would be untied,
and the old man kept me covered with a rifle. I’ve
worn my wrists raw trying to work out of my
bonds, but never with any success.</p>

<p>“Then yesterday afternoon the Indian went
away, and about two hours later this LeBlanc
arrived here with the girl. She was tied up, and the
old woman was given some instructions in French.
I don’t speak the language, so I don’t know what it
was all about.”</p>

<p>“He told her to wait until morning and then go
back home,” put in Ruth. “I can understand
French enough to know what he was talking
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, the woman went this morning after cooking
her breakfast and eating it in front of us without
even giving us a bite, and that’s all there is.
Nothing happened until you came here and saved
us from what was probably certain death, for I
believe it was meant that we should be left here to
starve to death.”</p>

<p>Simmons concluded his story, and then Garry
asked Ruth to add hers.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to tell you, because I know now
what a silly, foolish girl I was to do what I did;
but I suppose you will find out eventually, so I
might as well own up. I wanted to do something
to help you boys find what you were after, and
when I heard Lafe Green had come back to town,
I felt sure he was mixed up in this. I remembered
how you boys had gotten your information the
time you got the smugglers. So I went over to
the Crombie’s to see my girl friend, and made up
my mind that when I left there I would go out to
Green’s and go through the secret passage and discover
what I could. I wanted to find some clue to
show you boys that a girl could do things too, and
everything would have been all right but for a
sneeze. I got into the kitchen all right, and was
going to go upstairs, as I remembered your telling
about doing, and just as I got to the middle of the
floor I sneezed.</p>

<p>“I knew that everything was all off then, and
started to run for the back door, for I didn’t want
them to know I had come through the passage,
when Green and LeBlanc rushed out into the
kitchen and caught me.”</p>

<p>Ruth stopped and shuddered.</p>

<p>“Then they tried to make me tell them why I
came and how I got in, and LeBlanc twisted my
arm till I thought he would break it, but I shut my
teeth and wouldn’t say anything.</p>

<p>“Finally they locked me in a closet, and a little
while later put a nasty old cloth in my mouth and
brought me by automobile the same way they did
Mr. Simmons. It was LeBlanc’s brother who came
with him, and they hid in the woods with the
machine while Jean went away. He came back
with his arms full of bundles, and they put a pistol
so it stuck in my ribs and warned me to make no
sound and marched me to the canoe. When they
got me in, I was tied up and then Baptiste went
away and Jean brought me across the river and
here.”</p>

<p>“How about the buttons and the locket that I
found?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know about the locket for quite a
few minutes after I lost it. It must have been
while we were eating. We stopped and LeBlanc
built a fire and cooked some food. Just as soon as
I missed the locket I thought that someone might
find it, and so I thought then about leaving other
things behind. The only thing I could get at were
those buttons, and there were only four of those on
the side of my dress. I put them there for a little
ornament, and when I did it I never thought that
they would lead you to me. There, don’t you think
I was very foolish?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you were,” said Garry with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“That isn’t the right answer at all,” she pouted.
“You should have said I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“You should be mighty thankful that this young
man had brains enough to find us, young lady,”
said Simmons sternly. “By the way, there are two
questions I should like to ask you, young man.
First, how did you find us?”</p>

<p>Garry explained about the visit they had made
to Lafe Green’s and the confession they had obtained
from the tramp.</p>

<p>“The rest was just a hunch, and it turned out to
be a lucky one,” concluded Garry.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then. Now what made you
look so funny when I told you my name, and what
made you appear to doubt me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing very much, unless you can call it funny
when I tell you that we have seen and talked with
a man who says he is a United States postal inspector
whose name is Simmons, and who is now
at Hobart investigating the robberies.”</p>

<p>“What?” exploded the man. “Some one parading
under my name?”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” answered Garry dryly. “One of the
pair of you must be wrong.” Just then a thought
struck Garry. “I guess you’re the right one, and
something that puzzled me for a while has been
explained.”</p>

<p>Garry had remembered the puzzling sentence
that was broken off when the radio failed to work.
What was it his chum had said? Yes, something
about Simmons being arrested. Evidently the boys
had detected the fraud—for fraud the man posing
as Simmons must have been—and had him seized
before he could do any more damage.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll find the impostor safe in jail when
we get back to Hobart,” he told the real Simmons.
Then he related all that he knew of the supposed
inspector, and concluded by giving him a description
of the man.</p>

<p>“Why, I think I know who that is,” said Simmons
excitedly. “That description fits perfectly a
man named Sullivan, who was discharged from the
service about a year ago. There was never anything
proven on him, but circumstances surrounding
certain actions of his were suspicious, and he
was let go for the good of the service. In the post-office
department, a man must be above even the
breath of suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t tell what the outcome has been
until we get back to Hobart,” said Garry. “Which
reminds me, when are we going to start? I am
afraid that we will have to stay here until morning.
It would be a treacheorus job finding our way back
through the woods, and besides I need some rest,
and it is likely that you people do. You must be all
cramped up from being tied the way you were.
Now I suggest this: I have a blanket with me, and
Ruth can have that and sleep in the cabin. And
you can use our coats and sleep out here on some
boughs that I will cut. If you go to sleep now, I
will keep watch at the mouth of the ravine till
about one o’clock. Then I will wake you and you
do sentry till morning. When dawn comes, we will
hike back to the river and get across. There we’ll
telephone to Ruth’s grandfather and then get an
auto to take us around the out of the way road that
takes us to Hobart.”</p>

<p>This was accordingly agreed on, and soon Garry
was alone with his thoughts. The minutes dragged
into hours, and each snapping of the twigs or the
fall of an occasional dry branch quickened Garry
to the alert and prevented him from nodding, as
he was fairly tired after his hike to the cabin in the
ravine. It was about midnight, he thought, when
he heard a crashing through the undergrowth, and
he jumped to his feet. There was silence for a
moment and then more noise.</p>

<p>Garry wondered whether it was one of the Indians
or Le Blanc that was coming, and he gripped
his rifle tensely, awaiting the approach of the intruder.
For a time all was still, and he decided
that it was some woods animal.</p>

<p>Some instinct must have warned him to look
up to the edge of the ravine, and he saw a pair of
eyes gleaming in the darkness. Just then a form
launched itself from the overhanging rocks, straight
toward him!</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>NATE WEBSTER CALLS ON THE BOYS</span>
</h2>

<p>Garry waited not to discover what the flying
shape might be. Raising his rifle to his shoulder
he fired straight at the black mass, pumping the
shots from his magazine as fast as he could work
the mechanism.</p>

<p>He retreated hastily as he fired, and at the second
shot heard a scream of pain, then there was a thud
as some body struck the ground and writhed and
clawed.</p>

<p>Garry fired two more shots at the screeching mass
and then all was quiet and the struggling ceased.
The sound of the shots had, of course, wakened
Simmons, and he rushed forward to where Garry
was standing.</p>

<p>“What is it? Are we attacked? Did you kill
him?” The questions were shot out rapidly.</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet what it is, but if you wait a
moment I’ll have a look,” said Garry.</p>

<p>Just then Ruth came hurrying out. She had
snatched a burning stick from the fireplace and
held this as a torch. It must be remembered that
this entire occurrence took far less time than it
takes to tell it.</p>

<p>Taking the flickering torch from the girl, Garry
advanced to where the dark mass lay, and looked
it over. The others crowded around him. It was
a dark animal built something like a lioness, and as
it lay stretched out looked to be almost seven feet
long, measuring from tip of the nose to the tip of
the tail.</p>

<p>“What is that, a lion?” asked Simmons.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it is a specie of lion; I suppose you
could call it that,” answered Garry. “It’s generally
called a mountain lion; sometimes a panther,
and by the natives a ‘painter.’ Its correct name is
Puma. Say, he is sure a beauty, isn’t he? Good
thing he gave warning of his approach and put me
on guard, for if he had dropped on me from the
edge of the cliff, he would have made mincemeat of
me with those terrible fangs and sharp claws.”</p>

<p>“Are they generally to be feared?” asked Simmons.</p>

<p>“Of course they’re nothing you would want to
take into your cabin and lay down beside,” answered
Garry, “but as a rule they are not very
courageous. This one must have been ravenously
hungry to have even thought of attacking a human
being. Generally they prey on deer in the forest,
and if they summon up enough courage, will go on
farm land and raise havoc among sheep and young
cattle. This is such wild land here, that it had
probably had nothing to eat for some time, hence
its attempt to light on me. I wish there were more
time and no element of danger around here, for I
would like to skin it and take the pelt back with
me as a souvenir of the night. Perhaps we can
come here after we have taken Ruth home and
get it.”</p>

<p>Garry had still an hour to stand on guard, and so
Simmons went back to sleep. The boy was tired
himself, and welcomed the coming of the hour
when he was to be relieved.</p>

<p>At the appointed time, he roused Simmons and
handed over the rifle.</p>

<p>“Don’t hesitate to shoot if there is anything suspicious,
and that will wake me to come to your aid.
However, I don’t think there is much chance of
anyone coming at this time of the night.”</p>

<p>Garry was asleep almost as soon as he had
touched the boughs, and knew nothing until he felt
a hand shaking him. He looked up and saw that
it was just getting light.</p>

<p>“Now for a quick breakfast,” he cried, leaping
to his feet, “and then back to civilization and
safety.”</p>

<p>The breakfast over, they hurriedly left the place.</p>

<p>“We won’t have to bid any tearful farewell to
this place, will we Garry?” said Ruth.</p>

<p>All felt fresh and they made fine time in returning
over the course they had come. Since there
was no need for stopping and searching for trail,
they covered the distance in much less time than it
had taken Garry the previous day.</p>

<p>The worst of the going was the track from the
cabin in the ravine to the brook, but from there the
walking was comparatively easy. They had started
about six o’clock and by half-past nine reached the
point where Garry had discovered the campfire the
day before.</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Garry to Ruth, “I
haven’t given you back your locket yet. You
should keep that as a prize, for it was the first clue
that eventually led me to where you were imprisoned.”</p>

<p>“I shall keep it all my life,” declared the girl.</p>

<p>Simmons kept urging the others to hurry, for
he wanted to get on the ground and see what had
been done by the impostor who had paraded under
his name. He did not seem to take much comfort
in the statement of Garry that the false Simmons
had been arrested, so Garry kept silence.</p>

<p>At the river bank, Garry bade the party wait
while he looked at the place where the birch-bark
canoe had been secreted.</p>

<p>The canoe was gone.</p>

<p>He hastened to the place where he had concealed
his own craft, and was relieved to find that it was
still there, safe and sound, just as he had left it.</p>

<p>He drew it from its hiding place and let it down
into the water and paddled swiftly to where Simmons
and Ruth were waiting. They embarked and
then Garry pushed out into the river, plying his
paddle with long, swift strokes, that fairly set the
canoe dancing on the water.</p>

<p>“There,” murmured Ruth, as she sank back
against one of the thwarts. “Now I feel really
safe. I was afraid any minute that I would see the
horrible face of LeBlanc and have him pounce on
us out of the woods.”</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes more now and we’ll be in an
auto, provided we can hire one, and speeding
toward Hobart,” said Garry.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and soon the little
party were at the hotel, where he arranged for the
hiring of a flivver to carry them home. The hotel
keeper evinced some surprise at the sight of the
others, but Garry did not take the trouble to enlighten
him.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Garry, “do you happen to
know of any boys around here that own a birch-bark
canoe? I happened to damage one that I
found on the other shore, and would like to leave
my name in case you should hear about it.”</p>

<p>“Nobody in these parts owns a bark canoe,” declared
the hotel man positively, “but I’ll take your
name if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“It will take us almost as long to go by auto as
it would to walk across through the woods,” said
Garry, “for this is a mighty roundabout way; but it
will be easier than walking, and I think we all have
earned a little rest.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind a little bumping occasionally,”
said the chauffeur, “I can get you to Hobart in
about two hours; but it’s over a long stretch of
road that is hardly more than a lane.”</p>

<p>The party was unanimously agreed on preferring
the bumps to the extra time, and accordingly the
driver changed his direction and took a course that
led him to what seemed to be nothing more than an
abandoned tote road.</p>

<p>The driver spoke the truth when he said it might
be a little bumpy.</p>

<p>“Whew!” said Garry, as he was lifted almost a
foot out of his seat and came back with a thud that
jarred nearly every bone in his body. “I’m beginning
to think that we are getting more than we
bargained for.”</p>

<p>“I told you there were a few bumps,” said the
driver, grinning.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” declared Simmons, “only it
seems that we are missing the road altogether and
just jumping from bump to bump.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Ruth, as she hung on
to the side of the tin chariot. “We are getting to
Hobart all the quicker.”</p>

<p>Finally they struck decent road again, and the
driver stepped on the gas and fairly made the car
fly over the road.</p>

<p>When they reached the outskirts of the little village,
Ruth directed them to Aunt Abbie’s house,
and in a few moments she and her grandfather
were clasped in each other’s arms. Good old Aunt
Abbie was fluttering around, alternately patting
Ruth on the shoulder and then Garry.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have dinner right away,” she declared.
“You people must be starved.”</p>

<p>Aunt Abbie’s idea of a panacea for all the human
ills of the body was a “good meal.”</p>

<p>“Where are Dick and Phil?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>“Oh, they went traipsing off to the postoffice a
few minutes ago,” said Aunt Abbie. “If you just
ring up there on the ’phone you may find them
there. They flustered all around the house this
morning worrying about you, and then went out.”</p>

<p>Garry manipulated the telephone, for as in most
small villages, the telephones are old style and one
has to turn a crank or generator to call central.</p>

<p>Denton himself answered the ’phone. He was
mighty pleased to hear Garry’s voice and expressed
himself as “being plumb tickled to death to talk
with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your friends are here, and some time
they’ve been having while you were gone. Want
to talk to one of them, or shall I tell ’em to hike
over to Aunt Abbie’s right away?”</p>

<p>Garry told the postmaster to do the latter thing,
and then went back to where the others were assembled.</p>

<p>“Now let’s hear all that’s happened,” he said to
Mr. Everett.</p>

<p>“I guess perhaps we’d better wait till the boys
get back, and let them have the fun of telling you
themselves. It’s been pretty exciting, though, what
with bank burglars and masqueraders of the law.”</p>

<p>Just as Aunt Abbie called that dinner was ready,
Phil and Dick came tearing in. They leaped on
Garry, shaking hands with him and pounding him
exuberantly on the back.</p>

<p>“I told grandfather here,—yes, we call him that
now,”—said Dick as he saw the look of wonder on
Garry’s face. “I told him you would bring home
the bacon.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like that,” put in Ruth indignantly.
“Are you insinuating that I’m fat, Mr. Dick?
Bacon yourself!”</p>

<p>Everyone laughed at Dick’s stuttering apologies,
and then Garry demanded that they tell the story
of their adventures since he left them.</p>

<p>Phil and Dick in turn recited what they had
done, their stories being constantly interrupted by
exclamations from Aunt Abbie, who became more
and more excited as the stories were told, even
though she knew what had transpired during the
preceding hours.</p>

<p>“And, so we decided not to wait for you to come
back,” said Phil, as he took up the concluding
events. “We went and got the sheriff and brought
him to the postoffice, where we laid the whole matter
before him. He didn’t want to take any steps
at first, because he could not conceive of a U. S.
officer not being straight. Then Mr. Arthur, the
bank president, came in, and Denton called him
in and asked his advice. He took our side immediately,
and told the sheriff to go ahead and get
Simmons. I wouldn’t say for sure, but I guess
that Arthur has a lot of political influence in the
county. At any rate, the sheriff went ahead on his
say so, and came back with Simmons. There the
whole thing was put up to him, and say, you should
have heard him explode. He threatened everyone
with all kinds of things,—said he’d have the whole
postoffice department here, and hollered about
country sheriffs interfering with Federal officers
and all that sort of stuff. And the more he hollered,
the madder the sheriff got at being called a
‘hick,’ until if Simmons, calling him that for want
of a better name, had proven his innocence then
and there, I don’t believe the sheriff would have let
him go without an order from the President.</p>

<p>“Finally Dick came to bat with an idea that was
seized by all hands as the only sensible thing to do.
He suggested that Denton send a telegram to the
postal authorities at Washington with a description
of the man and asking if it checked up. The masquerader
shut up like a clam then. The sheriff
wrote out his description and Denton sent the wire.
About two hours later he got an answer saying
that no man in the postal service with the name of
Simmons answered that description, and ordered
him held pending an investigation. My guess now
is that there’s another inspector hot footing it here
from Washington about this time.”</p>

<p>“Good land of liberty. Will you people come in
and eat? That dinner must be stone cold by now,”
said anxious Aunt Abbie.</p>

<p>“I’d rather get a look at this chap before I eat,”
said Simmons. “I want to know who’s been using
my name and papers that were taken away from
me when I was captured.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s all you want, go in and eat till
I run upstairs. I have his picture up there,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>The party marched into the dining room, and in
a moment or two Dick was back with the group
picture he had taken the first day they arrived.</p>

<p>“There’s your man there,” said Dick, pointing
out the impostor.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m right,” said the inspector, after a
hasty scrutiny. “His name is Sullivan and he’s
been discharged from the service for some little
time now. I’ll go down and rescue my badge and
papers after awhile.”</p>

<p>Dinner was a merry affair, since it was in the
nature of a re-union.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Aunt Abbie, when all had finished,
“I’ll get that big dog of yours something to eat.
I’ve had to keep him down in the cellar while you
boys were out, else he’d have chased himself to
death all over town looking for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it to him,” volunteered Garry. He had
no sooner opened the cellar door than Sandy leaped
on him with a bark of delight, and the two friends,
boy and dog, had almost a rough and tumble.</p>

<p>There was little to do for the real Simmons. He
held a conference with Denton, and then proceeded
to the lock-up, where Sullivan was waiting before
being taken to the county jail.</p>

<p>Here he succeeded in getting a full confession
from the impostor, who saw that since he had been
caught, there was nothing to be gained by concealing
anything. Knowing what he did of the service,
he knew that the authorities would work relentlessly
until they had searched out every fact and
pinned it on him.</p>

<p>Simmons then wired an account of the affair
briefly to his superior, stating also that complete
report would be mailed. He prepared this report
and then allowed the boys to read it.</p>

<p>They protested when they finished it, for it was
largely a glowing account of their ability and bravery
in doing the work they had done. Simmons,
however, silenced their protests by stating that
whatever they thought, that was his idea, and that
was the way that the report was going.</p>

<p>But one thing did Sullivan refuse to tell, and that
was the writer of the threatening letters. Simmons
caused fingerprints to be taken of all the captives,
and though not pretending to be an expert, knew
enough of the science to be able to declare that none
of them compared with the print on the letter.</p>

<p>It happened that Dick’s photography stood in
good stead at this time, for Sullivan had destroyed
the originals, and but for the photographs, there
would have been no evidence.</p>

<p>“I take that to mean only one thing,” declared
Garry. “There is no one left on whom suspicion
could rest except Jean LeBlanc, and when LeBlanc
is caught, I am sure you’ll find that is his fingerprint.
It is probable that Sullivan knows that
LeBlanc is still free, and thinks that by keeping
silent he may aid his confederate in crime to some
degree. Now we seem to have this gang pretty
well rounded up. Only Jean and Baptiste are at
large, and I’m hoping that they will soon be under
lock and key. That pair are not fit to be free and
are a menace to any community where they may
be located.”</p>

<p>Later on in the afternoon, as they sat about relaxing
after their strenuous adventures, the ’phone
rang and Aunt Abbie said that Dick was wanted.
He came back a few moments later and remarked:</p>

<p>“Cut down that list of our enemies to one. The
sheriff says he sent out word to all the authorities
in the county last night, and one caught Baptiste
this morning at the railroad station. Wonder if
there isn’t some way we can get Jean? That would
sure be a complete round-up then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we can do,” said Garry.
“Only thing to do is to be vigilant every moment
and wait for him to try some trick, as he undoubtedly
will. Then we can muster a posse if necessary
and run him down. He’s such a slippery customer,
though, and seems to find out what’s going on so
quickly, that now his whole gang is arrested, he’ll
probably seek safety for a time in hiding.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that,” said Phil. “I’ve
got a strong hunch that he’ll be coming after our
scalps pretty soon. We’ve been lucky enough so
far to thwart him in every nefarious move that he
has made.”</p>

<p>“Well, time alone will tell that,” said Garry. As
he spoke, there came a knock at the door, and the
boys nearly fell off their chairs when they heard
Aunt Abbie say in the high-pitched voice that she
used when excited:</p>

<p>“Well, great land o’ Goshen. Nate Webster! I
haven’t seen you for years!”</p>

<h2 id='chXIII'

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIII</span><br/>
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>DICK’S FOREST STUNT</span>
</h2>

<p>“Do you suppose that’s our Nate Webster?” inquired
Garry.</p>

<p>“Quickest way to find out is to go and see,”
answered Dick, and suiting the word to the action
started for the front hall.</p>

<p>It was the Nate Webster they knew, and he
greeted the boys heartily.</p>

<p>“How do you happen to be in this part of the
state, Nate?” asked Garry.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought I’d like to see some of my old
friends up this way, and I found out from your
father where you were, so I just put a man in
charge of my place for a while and came up.
We’re going to get a couple of good rainy days
and that will stop any chance of fire for a time. In
fact it was lowering this morning when I started.
You know I used to be around here a spell of years
ago, and this is a bit of a vacation for me.”</p>

<p>The story of their adventures and those in
particular that related to the doings of LeBlanc were
retailed for Nate, and at the conclusion he asked
what they were going to do.</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps we’d wait for orders from
the Chief Ranger, and in the meantime just take it
easy for a day or two,” answered Garry.</p>

<p>“Might just as well, at least till the rainy days
are over,” agreed Nate.</p>

<p>They took a walk during the afternoon and met
some of Nate’s old friends, enjoying the reminiscences
that were started when old cronies of the
guide got to talking old times with him. They
brought Nate back to supper with them, and Garry
found a letter waiting for him.</p>

<p>He read the letter over, and then called his chums
together.</p>

<p>“This letter is going to cause rather a change in
our plans. From what I gather, my mother and
yours, Phil, are rather worried; and, furthermore,
Mother wants us to have a short vacation at the
beach with her before we go to school. Dad suggests
that we stay here a week or two, if we want,
and have a little fishing and swimming and so on,
without feeling that there is any work to do and
halt us from just enjoying ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Say, why wouldn’t this be a good time to go
and visit the mine, and see if after all it is really a
good one, or was just a vain hope,” said Phil.</p>

<p>“You know, I hope that there are some real tourmalines
there, for they are valuable things. You
know the last time that we were in Bangor, when I
slid out for awhile and you wondered where I
was. I was at the library, reading up on the stones.
I find that they are valuable for more than gems;
something I didn’t know before. They are used a
great deal in delicate electrical instruments, as they
are responsive to electricity and are used to measure
the intensity of radium emanations. Then they
are used by oculists to test lenses with. The finest
specimens are the ones that are used for gems, after
being cut, and the others are used in the electrical
apparatus. You know, I’d give most anything if
we could make some money out of the mine,” he
concluded wistfully.</p>

<p>Garry was about to answer, when he caught a
significant expression on Dick’s face. He did not
know what it was all about, but took it as an indication
that he should keep silent.</p>

<p>Soon after that Nate engaged Phil in conversation,
and perceiving this, Dick left the room, motioning
Garry to follow. They left the house and
walked down the street, and as soon as they were
out of hearing, Garry asked:</p>

<p>“What kind of a high sign were you trying to
give me, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Garry, if it’s the last thing we ever do, we’re
going to start for that mine right away. I see the
whole idea in the back of Phil’s head.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get your meaning yet,” responded Garry
in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“Dunderhead! It’s as simple as the nose on your
face. First thing that started him off was your reference
to our going away to school. You know
Phil hasn’t said a word about it to either of us
since the day we first mentioned it, except to refuse
Dad Boone’s offer to stake him through and let him
pay it up later on. But you can bet you that he’s
thought about it a lot. Now he has built up a lot
of hope on making money out of this mine. If it
is anywhere near successful, he could easily afford
then to go to school with us. Now does the idea
percolate through that thick skull of yours?”</p>

<p>“Thick is right, Dick,” admitted Garry, as he
rapped the offending skull with his knuckles.
“We’ll outfit up and start tomorrow. In the meantime
I’ll write Dad and explain matters to him, and
get him to secure our release from the State Forest
Ranger at Augusta. I think perhaps we’ve been of
enough service so that we can be let off. Anyway,
we would have to be released to carry out Dad’s
wishes about our vacation with Mother.”</p>

<p>They returned to the house and there broke the
news to Phil.</p>

<p>The boy said nothing, but the chums could tell
from the look on his face that the news was the
most welcome he had heard that summer. Both
Garry and Dick tactfully forebore to intimate that
they had discovered Phil’s secret, and stated that
they were off to the mine solely because it was a
lark, and would be an interesting conclusion to
their summer.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing, however. Once we start
operations at the mine, it will mean that the news
will spread about and as soon as we leave we will
have to hire a guard to take care of it for us, or
perhaps someone to work it until we have exhausted
the mine.”</p>

<p>“I have a bright idea,” exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p>“All right, little brightness, shoot it,” said Garry
laughing.</p>

<p>“We’ll just hire Nate Webster here; or better
than that, I propose that we give him a share in
the mine, and let him get a couple of trustworthy
friends of his to help him, and he can operate it
after we leave.”</p>

<p>“That’s a first class suggestion, Phil. What do
you say to it, Nate?” asked Garry, turning to the
old timer.</p>

<p>The question struck Nate rather by surprise, and
he made them tell him some more details of the
mine. When these had been furnished him, he
answered:</p>

<p>“Well, I’d be willing to take a chance at it. I’ve
done a little of everything but mining, and so I can
try that once. But I won’t take any share in the
mine. If you boys want to hire me at day wages,
all right; but the mine’s yours, and I don’t feel that
I should take a share when I’ve done nothin’
towards findin’ it.”</p>

<p>“That suits us all right, Nate, if it does you; for
we are not sure that it will pan out. If we were
sure it was O. K. I’d insist on giving you a share,
for you’ve helped us wonderfully mainy times this
summer.”</p>

<p>Some discussion ensued after this, and it was
finally terminated by Nate’s reluctantly agreeing to
take a share in the mine. He insisted, however,
that if they went on this basis, he must be permitted
to share and share alike in all expenses and take
his chance of luck along with the boys. After some
talk this was agreed to, and the boys wrote out a
business-like memorandum, making Nate a partner
in the venture.</p>

<p>Plans were then made for the outfitting. It was
decided that since all were anxious to get at the
business of mining, it would be a waste of time to
build a shack, and the weather might not continue
fine enough to use only a brush house. So a tent
was to be purchased. They found that Denton had
a large wall tent among his numerous articles in
the general store.</p>

<p>There was little to be bought except necessary
provisions, and these could be secured at Chester.
The essential thing to be purchased was dynamite,
and this too they found at Denton’s. It was something
that he had occasion to sell often to the farmers,
who used it to blow up stumps on the land that
was gradually being cleared and used for farming.</p>

<p>Bright and early next morning they started for
their mine. An auto was hired to carry them, and
on account of the dynamite the long way around
was taken.</p>

<p>“If we ever hit one of those bumps the way we
did coming from Chester with Ruth and Simmons,
we’d wake up in another world,” declared Garry.
Goodbyes were said, and arrangements made for
Ruth and her grandfather, together with Aunt
Abbie to visit them and see the mine in operation.</p>

<p>They reached the mine about noon, and a camp
site was selected about a hundred yards from the
stony face where the tourmalines, if there were any
really there, lay hidden. This spot was chosen
because of the proximity of a forest stream; that
would at once provide them with clear cold water,
and a chance for a bit of trout fishing now and
then.</p>

<p>Camping meant outdoor cooking again, and so
Dick’s first thought was for the building of a
proper stone camp fireplace.</p>

<p>Also he dug a hole, for they had brought shovels
with them to use in the mining, and prepared a
“beanhole” to use the next day. Practically all the
afternoon was taken in making camp, and a visit
was paid to the ledge and tomorrow’s operations
were planned.</p>

<p>Phil was made “engineer in charge,” for his
hours at the library had told him nearly all there
was to know about the mining of tourmalines. As
they sat around the campfire after supper, Phil explained
the process.</p>

<p>“It shouldn’t really be called mining; it’s almost
too simple an operation for that. Tourmalines are
generally found in pockets in crumbling places in a
ledge of rock, or are often found in the sandy subsoil.
No instance in this country has been known
where they were found at a greater depth than
eight feet. Also there is little or no way of determining
where there is a geological likelihood of
their being located, as in the case of oil, when a
geologist can tell whether the formation is that
which denotes the presence of oil. Lepidolite, followed
by smoky quartz and feldspar is a pretty good
indication, however, of their presence.”</p>

<p>“I suggest that we take and dig a bit along the
front of that ledge and perhaps find some pockets.
Then after we have tried that for awhile, we can
pick out likely spots in the face of the ledge which
indicate that it is crumbling there, and by using
very small charges of dynamite break it away and
screen or wash the contents of the pockets until we
find our tourmalines.”</p>

<p>Phil never gave thought to a chance of failure.
They had found one tourmaline there, and the old
map that had guided them to the spot had hinted
at riches. Also the faith of the first owner of the
map had transferred itself to Phil.</p>

<p>Work started in earnest the next morning, and
the four of them, the three chums and Nate, shoveled
away until their hands were blistered. It was
not until the fourth day that they were rewarded.</p>

<p>Nate was the one to whom the honor of finding
the first pocket was given. He gave a shout and
the chums ran to his side.</p>

<p>“I swan, but thar she is,” and he pointed with his
shovel to a half a dozen glinting objects that sparkled
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>All four dropped on their knees and investigated.
They gathered up handfuls of the earth and sifted
it through their fingers. Nearly twenty specimens
were obtained, while their excitement was unbounded.
Pale pink and green were the different
stones. Four in particular were beauties, being a
pale green, translucent and sparkling. These were
the ones that could be laid aside to be disposed of
as gems for rings or pins.</p>

<p>The next step was to start a more scientific way
of getting at the gems. To this end, Dick and Phil
were set to bring pails of water, while Garry and
Nate procured flat tin pans that had been provided
for the purpose. The method used was that which
is used in placer gold mining. A quantity of the
dirt was scooped up, and water poured in. Then
the pan was gently tilted back and forth; “rocking”
it is called by the miners, and the dirt gradually
was washed away, leaving the pebbles and
gems in the bottom of the pan. Then it was an
easy matter to pick from the pebbles the real gems.
Sometimes they would pan a dozen times before
they would pan a gem, and then they would be
lucky and pick a half dozen, sometimes half a score
of the glinting mineral.</p>

<p>The kind that could be sold for gems were a
rarity, but the specimens were all good and could
be used for commercial purposes.</p>

<p>After two days of panning they apparently exhausted
this particular pocket, and considered moving
a few feet and trying again.</p>

<p>Phil suggested that since they had found gems
in this particular spot, they blast away a small section
from the ledge. He pointed out the fact that
there was a fissure at one spot, and this might be
the place where a pocket was concealed in the stone.</p>

<p>As it was nearly nightfall, they decided to postpone
the blasting until the morning.</p>

<p>Around the campfire, after supper, they chatted
and listened while Nate told stories of the forest.
One of Nate’s stories was about the search that he
had once led for a camper that had gotten lost in
the forest, and how he had been found just in time
to prevent death from starvation and exposure.
This led to a discussion on the part of the boys as
to the foolishness of campers in straying so far
away from their party as to become lost.</p>

<p>“It’s a crazy thing for one unused to the woods
to do,” declared Dick. “And yet it seems such a
simple thing to do to keep from starving in the
woods. I know I wouldn’t suffer.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty broad statement to make, young
fellow,” warned Nate.</p>

<p>“I know I could do it,” persisted Dick. “First
place I’ve learned a lot of things from practical experience
since I’ve been in the woods, and second
place, ever since I was a kid and in the Boy Scouts,
I’ve studied about it.”</p>

<p>“You might make it for a couple of days, but
that’s a long time unless you’re used to the woods
and know them end for end and backwards and
forwards,” said Nate.</p>

<p>“Could live a week easy, and if I could live that
long, will you concede that I’d spend a summer
safely and without starving?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe you could,” said Nate.</p>

<p>“Say, listen, I’ll wager anything I’ve got that I
can do it, and by gosh, I’m going to do it anyway,
whether you fellows take me up or not,” he announced
stubbornly.</p>

<p>They ragged him for awhile and then saw that
he was in dead earnest about the matter. From
that point the talk developed into whether or not
the trick could be turned, and finally they agreed
to let Dick try if he wanted to. To make it a fair
test, however, they made him agree that if twenty-four
hours passed without his being able to get a
meal in the woods, that he would come out and
admit it was a failure.</p>

<p>“All right, that’s a go. Now what will you
allow me to have?” inquired Dick.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all; you’ve got to use Nature’s
weapons all the time,” promptly answered Phil.</p>

<p>“No, that’s hardly fair,” protested Nate. “The
average camper that got lost would have his knife,
and he’d likely have a hatchet stuck in his belt.
’Tain’t likely, though, that he’d have any food with
him; and if he were only out for a short stroll,
and got twisted in direction, and then lost, he
wouldn’t have his gun with him. Suppose we put
it this way: You’re in the woods lost, and through
an accident you lost your pack and rifle. That
leaves you just as I’ve seen you three or four times.
You’d have your hatchet and your lariat and that’s
all. We’ll even make it easier than that. You can
go in as you are now. I don’t know what you have
in your pockets, so we’ll let you have that much.
You can’t have your matches, though. Say you
fell out of a canoe when you lost your pack and
rifle, and wet your matches so they are useless.
That makes it harder.”</p>

<p>All agreed that this was a fair proposal, and
Dick planned to start the next morning. He determined
to take to the Forest Reserve, first because
he wanted to see it, and second because that seemed
to offer the best place to try the experiment. Dick
agreed to blaze a trail from where he started so
that in case of accident he could be followed.</p>

<p>Next morning all went with him to the river to
see him off, and Garry paddled him across the
river, using a canoe that he hired from a youngster
who was passing that way. They agreed that one
of the boys should come to the river at noon and
at six o’clock every day to see if he would be back,
having concluded the experiment was a failure.</p>

<p>Dick fell into the spirit of his own adventure,
and walked half a day into the forest, blazing a
trail as he went, and occasionally leaving some of
the usual trail signs and messages such as all scouts
and woodmen know. Then he pretended that he
was lost and started in to make plans for his living.
He cast about until he found a brook and set at his
first plan.</p>

<p>The first thing was a fire, and he had no matches.
That meant using the Indian method of firemaking.
The plan that he was to have anything that was in
his pockets the night before stood him in good
stead, for along with a few minor articles was a
stout piece of cord.</p>

<p>He procured some dry moss and tindery substance
and made a little heap of it. Then he found
a piece of dry bark, and inserted this in the tinder
after having made a small hole with the point of
his knife. Next he procured a dry stick and sharpened
this at both ends. Now all he would have to
do was insert the point into the hole in the bark,
and twist it briskly between his palms until it
started the blaze. This process, however, takes
quite a bit of time, owing to the fact that a great
speed cannot be attained, hence there is less friction,
and so the tinder will not ignite quickly.</p>

<p>There was a way that this could be done quicker
and easier. He found a flat piece of wood and
bored a small hole in that. Then he searched until
he found a crooked stick, and tied his cord loosely
at each end. Making a loop in the cord, he slipped
it over the stick with the pointed ends. Now all
that needed to be done was to put one end in the
tinder, and cap the other end with the piece of
wood. Holding this bit of wood in one hand, and
the “bow” in the other, he sawed back and forth,
the string causing the stick to revolve back and
forth with great rapidity.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes he had his fire going
briskly. Now the next question was something to
eat. He heard a slight splash in the stream near
him, and thought at once of trout.</p>

<p>How to catch them was the next question. That
was soon solved.</p>

<p>What boy does not have a pin or two sticking
somewhere in his clothes—generally in his coat
lapel. Dick found one, and after some trouble,
succeeded in turning the point back about a sixteenth
of an inch. This corresponded to the barb
of a fish hook. Bending the rest of the pin into a
hook was simple.</p>

<p>Now for a line. His cord that he used in the fire
making was too heavy, and not long enough. However,
Dick soon remedied the lack. He fished out
the tail of his cotton khaki shirt, and after a few
minutes’ work with the point of his knife, succeeded
in drawing out a few of the strong threads.
Knotting these together, he had a line.</p>

<p>Bait was now the only thing needed, and a few
seconds’ search under the rocks along the shore of
the brook uncovered several slugs such as cling to
the wet bottom of rocks. Baiting his hook, he
threw it in, and in a few minutes had a fine trout.
Of course this kind of fishing was crude. Instead
of delicately playing the trout, he simply snapped
the line back, and landed the fish on the shore in
back of him. He cleaned the fish with his knife,
stuck it on the end of a stick and roasted it. There
was one dinner, he thought.</p>

<p>A drink from the stream completed the meal.
Not a heavy one, but still it would have kept starvation
away had he been really lost. He spent the
afternoon in exploring, and in the course of his
wandering, always taking care to notice his trail
so that he could get back to the stream and his
campfire, he came upon a moist bit of ground.</p>

<p>Dick spied something that meant an addition to
his supper.</p>

<p>He bent closer to examine the find. It consisted
of mushrooms. He was familiar with the various
kinds of poisonous and edible fungi, and an examination
of the pink gills and shape of the mushroom
convinced him these were all right to eat. Beyond
the swampy place was a clump of birches, and here
he supplied himself with a quantity of bark.</p>

<p>This would come in handy at a later time to
make receptacles of. Dick gathered a quantity of
the mushrooms, and returned to his campfire. Now
he determined to try an experiment of which he
was somewhat skeptical. He had read of the Indians
doing it, and so set to work to try it.</p>

<p>He piled on wood until he had a good heap of
coals, then made a cone of birch bark, fastening it
by sticking a twig through at intervals. Filling
this with water, he imbedded the cone in the coals,
and threw in some of his mushrooms.</p>

<p>The theory of the bark kettle is that the water
will keep the bark wet enough at all times so that
the coals will not quite burn through. It cannot
be lifted from the coals; the water or stuff that is
cooking must be dipped out. Eventually the bark
will be consumed, but not before the water or food
has been heated sufficiently to use.</p>

<p>Dick had to admit that he was surprised when
he found that the contrivance worked, for he had
doubted whether or not it would be a success.
Having cooked his mushrooms, he sought the rocks
again for bait for a fish, and made another discovery.
Under some of the biggest rocks were crawfish.
He knew that these could be roasted and
eaten.</p>

<p>These, however, would do for another day.
Then there were roots and berries of various kinds
that could be used as sustenance. Altogether there
was a quantity of foodstuff that he could use.</p>

<p>He rolled in that night close to the fire, satisfied
that he would live the week out in comfort and
have the laugh on his friends.</p>

<p>Next morning, after another breakfast of fish
and mushrooms, he determined to push up the
stream and seek out a new camp place. After a
walk that took him nearly half the morning, he
branched away from the stream and lay down for
a rest. Here he made a discovery that set him
thinking. The find was nothing more nor less than
a few feathers. He knew after a brief examination
that these were from wild turkeys who probably
roosted in the trees during the night. The finding
of the feathers convinced him that this was perhaps
a natural roost for the birds.</p>

<p>After an afternoon of exploration, during which
he found some wild raspberries, he came back to
the turkey roost spot as he called it. He found he
was right in his first conjecture. There were several
turkeys roosting on some of the lower branches.
Dick procured several good-sized rocks and hurled
them at the birds. Two good shots each brought
down a turkey, partially stunned. It was the work
of a minute to wring their necks.</p>

<p>He cleaned them and roasted them in the coals,
and after eating what he wanted, wrapped the
cooked flesh in bark and put it by for the next day.</p>

<p>The third morning found him exuberant and
cheerful, and he decided to take a long trek in the
woods. Twice during the morning he found signs
that the mounted Rangers had passed that way,
and figured that he was in the line of patrol. He
did not want to meet the Rangers so early, as he
wanted to subsist entirely on his own discoveries.
The afternoon brought him to the foot of a good-sized
hill, almost a young mountain.</p>

<p>He noted the location of a spring for use that
night, and decided to utilize the remaining hours
of light in climbing up the big hill to get a look at
the surrounding country.</p>

<p>The climb consumed a good hour of hard work,
and he had almost reached the top when he found
that he was looking at a cabin. It was perched
near the edge of a cliff, and looking out, he figured
that there must be a sheer drop of perhaps a hundred
feet or more.</p>

<p>At first Dick thought this was the lookout of a
Ranger, and entered. There were no maps, however,
nor anything else to indicate that the cabin
was a lookout. Someone had built a fire recently
there, though, and he looked about the cabin.
There was a crude cupboard at one end, and in this
he found several packages of food.</p>

<p>Dick had some loose change in his pocket, and
he was debating on whether a lost man would have
the right to take some and leave the money in
return.</p>

<p>As he pondered over the ethics of this, he heard
something that caused a flutter of excitement.</p>

<p>Someone was nearing the cabin. This in itself
would have caused him no great concern, except
that whoever was coming was singing softly to
himself an old French chanson.</p>

<p>Dick darted to the cabin door, and there, facing
him, stood the last person in the world that he
wanted to see—Jean LeBlanc.</p>

</h2>

<p>Left to pursue their mining, Nate and the two
Ranger boys worked the remainder of the morning,
and mined several handsome specimens. These
Garry had been carrying loose in his pocket, but now
they had become too bulky, and so they were transferred
to a canvas bag.</p>

<p>Phil suggested that they be secreted in the tent,
and so a hole was dug and the bag inserted. Then
the dirt was replaced, and the boughs that made
one of the bunks thrown back there.</p>

<p>About midafternoon, another rich pocket was
unearthed by Garry, and when this was panned,
revealed a score of fine commercial gems.</p>

<p>Phil was detailed to take them to the tent and
add them to the others. This he did, and had
barely uncovered the gems and was putting the
latest find with their companions, when he was
struck over the head with a heavy club. His last
remembrance, as he floated away into
unconsciousness, was the sound of a mocking laugh that belonged
to none other than their deadly enemy, the
halfbreed.</p>

<p>Garry waited several minutes for Phil to return,
and when his chum failed to come back, walked to
the tent to see what was delaying him.</p>

<p>He opened the tent flap and was shocked to see
Phil lying unconscious on the ground. He raised
his voice and called to Nate, who came rushing
from the ledge.</p>

<p>“Someone’s knocked Phil out,” he told Nate.
“Run and get a pail of water.”</p>

<p>Nate didn’t stop to ask questions, but hastened to
do Garry’s bidding.</p>

<p>He had hardly gotten outside the tent, however,
when Garry called him back.</p>

<p>“I was so startled I forgot what I was doing for
a minute. We don’t need water. Grab a blanket,
Nate, and we’ll roll him up in that. A person
knocked unconscious suffers a bit of a shock. What
he needs now is warmth. There, now he’s covered
up. Chafe one of his hands and arms, Nate, and
I’ll take the other. We want to start the circulation
flowing rapidly.”</p>

<p>They worked swiftly for several minutes, and
finally Phil’s eyelids fluttered weakly. Then, as
returning consciousness dawned, he struggled to
sit up.</p>

<p>“Lie back there quietly and keep still,” ordered
Garry.</p>

<p>“No, I’m all right,” protested Phil weakly.
Then he thought of something.</p>

<p>“The tourmalines,” he gasped. “Look for them.”</p>

<p>Garry ran to the hole made for the canvas bag.</p>

<p>The bag was gone!</p>

<p>But in searching about the tent to see if perchance
they had been misplaced, Nate came upon
a piece of paper, weighted down by a pebble.</p>

<p>“There’s your thief and the man who knocked
out Phil,” he said.</p>

<p>There was nothing on the paper but the crude
representation of a bear.</p>

<p>“The Bear,” said Garry disgustedly. “Jean LeBlanc’s
nickname. Oh, Nate, what a lot of fools
we’ve been. We should have kept a watch for him
every minute. Now here’s all our time gone, and
our valuable gems. Of course we may get others,
but suppose the pockets give out. All gone.”</p>

<p>Phil said nothing, but Garry knew that he saw
his visions of going to school with his chums in the
fall going a-glimmering.</p>

<p>He strove to console Phil, who remained silent.</p>

<p>Finally Phil began to recover fully from the
effects of the blow, and with the recovery his spirits
rallied.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just our hard luck for the present,”
he said philosophically. “It means that we’ll have
to get out and hustle a bit harder to make up. I
know that there are more tourmalines there. I
believe we have only just begun on the mine.”</p>

<p>Both Nate and Garry insisted, however, that Phil
stay quiet for the rest of the afternoon, despite his
protestations that he was all right.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have gone out that time, if it wasn’t
that the club LeBlanc used hit me on the tender
spot that was left from the bump I got when I fell
off the train. That and my game ankle have almost
made a blooming invalid out of me.”</p>

<p>He was insistent about getting up, and it is probable
that his friends would have yielded to his demands,
except that at that moment a shadow darkened
the doorway of the tent, and they looked up
to see the figure of their friend, the Hermit.</p>

<p>They would hardly have recognized him except
for his clothing, for he had had his hair cut and
his beard shaved off.</p>

<p>They bade him a hearty welcome, and asked how
he had found them. He explained that he had
found that they had come to Hobart and had
walked there, taking almost a week to make the
trip, and arriving at Hobart had been directed to
Denton, who told where the boys and Nate might
be found.</p>

<p>Garry caught himself gazing at the Hermit all
the rest of the afternoon. There was something
puzzling, something that lurked in his mind that he
could not quite uncover. Then a wild thought
came. He went outside the tent, and called Nate
out.</p>

<p>“Listen carefully now, please, Nate. I may be
crazy, and then again if I’m right, it may be the
biggest thing in life for two people. I haven’t time
to explain now. But on no condition let the Hermit
out of your sight until I can get my father here.
Keep him if you have to tie him to do it.”</p>

<p>Garry dashed away toward the town, which lay
some four miles distant. He arrived at the station
and found that it was closed. The next objective
was the hotel, and here he inquired for the residence
of the station agent. To his dismay he was
told that the station agent lived some twenty miles
down the road, and had gone there for a short time.
He had taken the last down train, and a relief
operator would come in the morning to take his
shift during his time off.</p>

<p>“You see, there are no trains here after nightfall,
and so there’s no need for a telegrapher or station
agent,” explained the hotel owner.</p>

<p>“But this may be a matter of life and death,”
cried Garry. “Look here, I can send a message myself.
Can you suggest any way of getting into the
station?”</p>

<p>“Well, young man, I’ll tell you what I’ll do.
There isn’t any chief of police or the like of that
here, but I’m a Justice of the Peace, and maybe
that will give me authority to bust a window in the
station and let you in.”</p>

<p>“That will be the ticket,” said Garry.</p>

<p>The hotel man got his hat and a screwdriver,
and they repaired to the station. Here the hotel
man stuck the screwdriver under the window latch,
and with a quick snap forced it open.</p>

<p>“Guess I could qualify for a good burglar after
this, and I’ll probably catch merry blazes in the
morning, but I’ll take a chance,” he said.</p>

<p>He boosted Garry in through the window and
followed himself. Once at the instrument, Garry
opened the key and began calling for any station.
Stations have each a particular letter combination,
and there is, in addition, a code combination that
calls the nearest man on the line to answer. In a
few seconds he got a reply and ticked an explanation
that he was at Chester and desired to send an
urgent message.</p>

<p>“Who are you, you’re not Campbell,” ticked the
man at the other station.</p>

<p>Telegraph operators who are acquainted with
each other, can tell the “send” of a telegrapher as
easily as a person can recognize the handwriting
of a close friend.</p>

<p>Garry explained that he was only an amateur and
that he had to get off this emergency message. The
explanation evidently satisfied the man, who told
him to “shoot” his message, promising to relay it
promptly to Colfax.</p>

<p>Here is what Garry sent to his father:</p>

<p>“Come to Chester at once. Most urgent. Please
let nothing delay you. Matter of grave importance.
Answer immediately.”</p>

<p>He signed his name to it, and then inquired how
long the other operator would be on duty. He
learned to his gratification that the man would be
there until midnight, and promised to relay immediately
any answer that would come.</p>

<p>The hotel proprietor, Graves by name, when he
saw Garry’s familiarity with the telegraph, was
convinced that everything was all right, and agreed
to let him remain and see if a message would come
in answer.</p>

<p>Garry fretted and fumed with impatience for
nearly two hours, and then the ticker started, and
he got the following message:</p>

<p>“Am in Bangor. Mother ’phoned me about message.
Don’t understand your wire, but will start
in morning and arrive Chester tomorrow evening.
Meet me.”</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Garry ticked his thanks to
the other operator and prepared to go. He insisted
on paying Graves something for his trouble, and
after consulting a rate book that hung on a nail
over the telegraph instrument, left the costs of the
telegram on the table.</p>

<p>It was almost eleven o’clock when he came back
to the tent. The hermit was asleep on a bough bed
that he had fixed, and did not wake when Garry
entered, as did Phil and Nate. He whispered to
them to come outside, and they did.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Nate, “what’s all the shooin’ for?”</p>

<p>“Not so loud,” cautioned Garry. “Here’s the
answer.”</p>

<p>Then he bent closer and whispered something.
It made them utter surprised exclamations which
they immediately muffled after a warning nudge
from Garry.</p>

<p>“So, now,” concluded the Ranger leader, “all we
can do is wait until Dad gets here tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>For Nate and the two boys the next day passed
on leaden feet. They went about their mining, as
usual, and were aided by the hermit, who displayed
a remarkable knowledge of geology, and when told
that they were mining for tourmalines, told them
something of the early history of the stones,—astrekkers
or “ashdrawers” as the Dutch called them,
because of their magnetic property in picking up
bits of straw or ashes. The boys learned for the
first time how they had been discovered on Mount
Apatite in Paris, Maine, by two boys who were out
hunting.</p>

<p>About half-past three Garry departed for Chester
to meet his father on the five o’clock train. He
arrived several minutes before train time, and
chatted with the agent and explained what he had
done the night before.</p>

<p>When the train arrived, Mr. Boone was the first
to alight, and Garry rushed forward to meet him.
After they had shaken hands, Mr. Boone demanded
to know if anyone had been hurt.</p>

<p>“No, everyone’s all right. Dick is away in the
woods doing a Joe Knowles, but what we wanted
is to find that I’m right on the biggest hunch I ever
had, or else crazy as a loon. Now I’m not going
to say anything more till we get to camp, for I
want to see your reaction to what I’m going to
show you without having influenced you.”</p>

<p>They reached the tent, and Garry called out:</p>

<p>“Oh, Hermit, come out just a minute.”</p>

<p>The hermit parted the flap and stepped outside.
He looked blankly at Mr. Boone and bowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Boone stared at the hermit, however, as
though he were looking at a spirit from the world
beyond. Then he cried:</p>

<p>“Great Heavens! It’s Dick’s father!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah,” shouted Garry, and he was joined in
his jubilation by Phil. Even Nate shared in the
exuberance.</p>

<p>All this time the hermit looked puzzled at the
uproar. Finally Mr. Boone turned to him, and
stretching out his hand, advanced and said:</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Richard?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I don’t think I ever saw you before.”</p>

<p>Garry looked significantly at his father and, unobserved
by the hermit, slightly tapped his forehead.</p>

<p>“You know young Dick, don’t you?” pursued
Mr. Boone.</p>

<p>“Of course I know Dick; he’s a fine young man,
too,” answered the hermit, who we will now call
Prof. Wallace.</p>

<p>“Well, you are Professor Richard Wallace and
Dick is your son.”</p>

<p>A look of wonder spread over the professor’s
face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right. I don’t know who I am
or where I came from years ago. All I know is
that I have lived in the forest for many years.”</p>

<p>Very slowly and gently Mr. Boone explained
about the previous accident and the escape from the
hospital before the operation. When he had concluded,
the professor asked:</p>

<p>“You say there was to have been an operation?
Is there anything to prevent that being done now?”</p>

<p>“No, we will take you back in the morning to
Boston and have the best surgeons there do it.”</p>

<p>So the matter was arranged. However, knowing
the peculiarity of the Hermit, as they still thought
of him, Garry and Phil alternated in keeping watch
that night. They figured that his talk with Mr.
Boone might have been during a particularly lucid
moment, and that the old trouble would come back
on him, and he would disappear as he had done on
so many other occasions.</p>

<p>However, nothing happened, and the next morning
Mr. Boone took him to Chester to board the
train that would eventually take them to Boston.
It was agreed that Dick should not be told of
the visit of the hermit, and that the matter should
be kept a secret to be sprung on him after the
operation.</p>

<p>“And believe me, Nate and Phil,” declared Garry,
“Dick will be the happiest boy in the world, when
he learns he has found his father.”</p>

</h2>

<p>LeBlanc stood there facing the astonished Dick,
and a cruel leer spread over his face. He reached
for a knife that stuck in his belt, and said softly in
a whisper, as sibilant and venomous as the hissing
of a snake:</p>

<p>“Ah, mon ami, we meet again. The last time.”</p>

<p>Long after that, Dick used to ask himself how
it was that he managed to capture the halfbreed.
The only solution that he could find was that he
had acted solely on pure instinct.</p>

<p>As we know, Dick had been rummaging through
the cupboard when he heard the singer approach.
In his hand he still held a large can of tomatoes
which he had contemplated opening.</p>

<p>He saw LeBlanc’s leering grin, then quick as a
flash and straight as a die, he cast the heavy can
straight at the halfbreed’s face.</p>

<p>The can struck LeBlanc on the forehead, just
above the eyes. With a groan he slipped to the
ground, the knife falling from his hand and clattering
on the pebbles on the ground.</p>

<p>Never waiting to look to see whether the blow
had killed or merely stunned “The Bear,” Dick
whipped his lasso from his belt where it hung, and
flopping the limp body of the halfbreed over, slipped
the noose over his wrists and drew it tight. He
took several turns, and then bound the tied wrists
to the body. Just for safety’s sake he threw a turn
of the rope over the unconscious Frenchman’s feet
and then waited to see if he would come to.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the man groaned and then
stirred, trying to get up. He found that he was
solidly bound, and when he recovered his voice,
hurled imprecations at his captor.</p>

<p>Dick then searched the man and found a revolver,
and then noticing a lump in his shirt, ripped
it open and drew forth a canvas bag.</p>

<p>He opened it and looked in, and found to his
great surprise that it was filled with rough tourmalines,
among which he recognized some that they
had mined, and noted particularly for some distinguishable
mark.</p>

<p>He began to worry about the safety of his chums,
wondering whether LeBlanc had stolen the gems by
stealth, or whether there had been a battle and
some one at the mine had been hurt.</p>

<p>He questioned the halfbreed but received only
threats and curses for answers.</p>

<p>“All right; if you won’t talk, best thing to do is
to get there without delay and see for ourselves.
Now, LeBlanc, we’re going home on the double
trot. Anytime you make a false step, or attempt
to escape, or lessen your speed, I’ll not have the
slightest hesitation in putting a bullet in you. Now,
en avant, understand that? It’s good French for
get a wiggle on you.”</p>

<p>Dick and his captive set off down the mountain.
Dick knew that there would be no sleep that night,
but he intended to rest, and figured on binding LeBlanc
tightly to a tree during the dark hours. If
he had known the country, he would have marched
through the night, but it would be fatal to get lost
at this point in the game.</p>

<p>Just after dusk he prepared to tie LeBlanc up,
when he heard the thud of horses’ hoofs in the distance,
and set up a whoop. In a moment or two a
mounted Ranger appeared.</p>

<p>He looked in surprise at the pair before him, and
then in a brisk tone demanded to know the meaning
of the sight.</p>

<p>Dick drew from his pocket the Ranger badge and
explained who he was. He told the Ranger that he
was taking LeBlanc, who was wanted for half a
dozen or more serious crimes, back to Chester and
thence to Hobart to turn him over to the sheriff.</p>

<p>When Dick told of his plan for the night, the
Ranger told him that would be unnecessary, for he
had a cabin about two miles and a half away.</p>

<p>“You hop up here behind me, and we’ll make the
critter with you use Shank’s Mare.”</p>

<p>Dick had now given up all idea of his week in
the woods. All he wanted to do was to get LeBlanc
in the hands of the law and see how his
chums were faring.</p>

<p>At the Ranger’s cabin he found a second waiting,
for occasionally the men on the patrol in the Forest
Reserve travelled in pairs.</p>

<p>A good hot meal was waiting, and he enjoyed it
to the limit. LeBlanc’s hands were loosened sufficiently
for him to eat, but with two sizable men
and a boy to watch him, he knew it would be futile
to attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Dick entertained the Rangers vastly during the
meal with his account of how he had subsisted during
his stay in the forest.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I would have gotten along
so well,” said one of them, “and I’ve been in this
Reserve here for four seasons now.”</p>

<p>The next morning was gloomy and drizzly, and
so it was arranged for Dick to make time by riding
double with the Ranger, while LeBlanc was tied on
a led horse.</p>

<p>They reached the river bank an hour before noon,
and here Dick had figured he would have to wait
until his chums kept the agreed upon noon-time
rendezvous.</p>

<p>This was rendered unnecessary, however, when
they saw a boy rowing a flatboat down the river.
They hailed him and arranged to have him stay and
watch the horses for a couple of hours, while the
Ranger and Dick rowed LeBlanc across the river
and lodged him in the lock-up.</p>

<p>Dick then got into communication with the
sheriff, who charged the constable to guard the
prisoner with every precaution, and under no circumstances
was he to be allowed bail by the Justice
of the Peace, should any be offered.</p>

<p>The Ranger left after receiving the hearty thanks
of Dick, and he set out in a hurry for the mine. He
found his chums just on the point of heading for
the river, and then ensued many explanations.</p>

<p>Great was the delight of the chums when Dick
produced the bag of tourmalines, which he kept
until the end of his story, and then displayed with a
dramatic gesture.</p>

<p>Not a word was said to Dick about his father’s
having been found, but the fat boy could not help
but notice the tension that prevailed about the camp.
Twice Garry left the mine to go to the telegraph
office, but with no result. The next day at noon,
however, he received a brief wire from his father.
It said:</p>

<p>“Operation a success. Bring Dick and hurry to
Boston. Come to Massachusetts Homeopathic
Hospital.”</p>

<p>Arrangements were hastily made to close up
their summer’s stay. Dick was still in the dark,
but his chums would not yet enlighten him. Nate
Webster was to remain in charge of the mining,
and when Garry proposed that he hire George
Washington Dudley, the gum-hunter, and any other
help that he needed, Nate agreed enthusiastically,
for he and Dud were old friends of years ago.</p>

<p>The long trip to Boston was finally ended, and
guiding the perplexed Dick, they got a taxi at the
North Station and rushed to the hospital. Here
they were met by Mr. Boone. He took Dick to
one side and quietly told him that the Hermit was
his father and that he had recovered his mind and
memory after the operation. Dick was led to the
private room, and there Mr. Boone left father and
son together for a few moments. When the doctor
finally shooed Dick out of the room, he silently
grasped the hands of Mr. Boone and his chums, but
his voice was too choked for utterance.</p>

<p>And so we leave the Ranger Boys, who had
displayed real nerve and bravery throughout their
summer. Dick received his reward, in the finding
of his father. Phil’s share of the mine would permit
him to attend Farnham Hall with his chums
that year.</p>

<p>“But what good thing has come to Garry?” demanded
Dick.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve got what I wanted most,—the thing
that I wondered all summer how we could bring
about. That is the knowledge that the Three
Ranger Boys will be together for some time to
come, and the knowledge that I have two of the
finest friends that could ever be given a fellow;
and last but not least, I have a share in the Ruth
mine, one of the richest things in the state. What
more could I have?”</p>

<p>“Well,” whispered Dick to Phil, “If I’m any
good at reading ‘sign,’ when he’s a little older
he’ll have something else besides the mine that’s
named Ruth.”</p>

<p>And here we leave the Extraordinary Unit of
the Maine State Ranger Service.</p>
